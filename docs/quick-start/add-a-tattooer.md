# Quick Start: Add a tattooer

Since Harley is the user who installed REV23 Desktop and went through the setup wizard, an account for her was automatically created and added to the manager role. However, we will still need to add Pam as a tattooer (in the Service Provider role) and Selina as a body piercer and manager.

1. Navigate to **Security > Employees**.
   
2. Click the New action on the ribbon. The Employee Detail View will appear.
   
3. Fill out the basic information for the user. We've filled out the standard details, such as her name and gender and you can get as detailed (or basic) as you want with this information. There are additional properties you can explore now, but are outside of the scope of this quick start. Here are the things you should pay attention to now:

    - **User Name:** User name is required. Usually a first name will be acceptable, or first initial + last name. Whatever works for you!
    - **Email address:** Preferably one they can check using their mobile device. If you're going to set them up to see their schedule from their phone, this is the email address the instructions will go to.
    - **Mobile phone + Provider:** This will allow this user to receive text messages from the system, for example if a client cancels an appointment within 24-hours, the artist can be notified by text.
    - **Use Calendar:** Whether this person will be visible on the shop's calendar.
    - **Display Color:** The appearance of this user on the schedule.
    - **Display Order:** The order in which the user will appear on the schedule. The lower the number, the earlier they appear.
    - **Use Cloud Calendar:** Whether the users calendar is uploaded to REV23 Cloud Calendar.
    - **Require a password change on next log on:** By default, new users have an empty password. Checking this option will force them to select a new password when they log on for the first time.

4. Click the Add Roles action in the ribbon. Roles are security permissions this user will have access to when they log on. In this case, we are going to assign the user to only to the Service Provider role. They will be able to see their own services, and schedule appointments for themselves, but other than that, they do not have much access to the system. Once we select the roles we want, click OK.

    > Hint: You can select multiple roles by holding down the CTRL key on the keyboard while clicking each role.

5. Since this user is a tattooer, we need to tell REV23 Desktop that they perform the Tattoo service type, as well as how they are paid for it. Click the Add Service Types action.

    > Note: You could also navigate to the users Service Types tab and click the New action on the nested list view to add a single service type. However, using the Add Service Types action, we're able to demonstrate how you can add multiple service types to a user at once by holding down the CTRL key on your keyboard as you click each service type. This saves a lot of time when adding piercers to their service types, as there are many of them, and that is how we will add Selina.

    We will set the Commission Type to Percent and the Commission Percentage to 50%.

    Select Tattoo in the service types nested list view and click OK.

    This user is now added to the Tattoo service type and will receive a 50% commission.

6. Click the Schedule tab to set this user's schedule. Select the days and times they are available in the Fixed Schedule group.

7. We're now done with this user. Click the Save & Close action on this record to close the Employee Detail View.

We are also going to add Selina Kyle as a user. She is a body piercer and manager of the shop. She receives a 50% commission on her piercing services, and will use the Time Clock to clock in and out with an hourly rate of $5.00. See if you can get her, or a similar user added.

Remember, using the Add Service Types button, you can add a piercer to multiple piercings all at once by selecting them all in the list view. Here are a few ways to practice selecting multiple items.

Hold down the CTRL key while clicking each item. This will keep each item you click selected. Clicking it again will deselect it.
Select the first item in the list and hold down the SHIFT key while clicking another item in the list (such as the last item). This will select every item in-between.
Click into the list and press CTRL+A. This will select all items in the list. 

Now that we have users created who can perform services, let's schedule an appointment for Pam.
