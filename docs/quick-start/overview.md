Welcome to Gotham City Tattoo & Piercing!

Harley Quinn, former accomplice of The Joker, has given up her villainous ways. She's decided to put her tattooing talent to use, and has started a new body modification business. But one thing has always bothered at her... just who was Batman? With her new business, she's got an idea that she thinks will allow her to discover his secret identity. By tattooing and piercing the citizens of Gotham, she will be able to look for any distinctive scars or other clues that would show signs that the client is possibly the mysterious Batman. In the meantime though, she wants to put out some killer artwork and have some fun.

Harley has enlisted her friends to help out at the shop. She has hired Pam Isley, also known as Poison Ivy, who happens to be a gifted tattoo artist (mostly floral designs); and Selena Kyle, also known as Catwoman, as a body piercer, and manager of the shop. Each will be paid 50% commission on their services. As the manager, Selena will also receive hourly pay of $5.00/hour.

They've made the decision to use REV23 Desktop, and they're ready to get started!
