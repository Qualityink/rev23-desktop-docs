# Quick Start: Run reports

Well, the day is about at a close. Let's run a couple of reports to see how things look.

1. Navigate to Reports -> Reports.

2. Double click the Employee Payout report to run it. Supply a Start and End Date in the Parameters panel, and click the Submit action. We will run it for yesterday and today. A two page report appears containing the payout information for both Pam and Selina. Close the Employee Payout Report.

3. Double click the Payout Summary. Again, supply a Start and End Date parameter, and click the Submit button. We can see a summary of transactions that occurred, but this doesn't quite give us all the detail we need. Close the Payment Summary Report.

4. Double click the Payment Detail Report. Once again, supply a start and end date, then submit. Now we can see a breakdown of those payments and remember there was a $20.00 cash refund. Close the Payment Detail Report.

There is no shortage of reports you can run in REV23 Desktop! 

After a long day, Selina is itching to get out of here for the night and is ready to clock out.
