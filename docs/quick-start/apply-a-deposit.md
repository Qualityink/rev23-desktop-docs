# Quick Start: Apply a deposit

The Commissioner's new tattoo looks awesome thanks to Pam, and he's ready to pay. He put down a $50.00 cash deposit yesterday when he scheduled the appointment, so we need to make sure that is applied.

1. Open the **Service Detail View** of the tattoo we're ready to pay for. You can do this either by selecting the appointment in the scheduler and clicking the Start Service action again (it will just reopen the service we already started) - OR - navigate to Home -> Services, and double click the record.

2. Click the **Sale** action. This will open the Sale Detail View for us to manage the sale, just like we did in the Starting the sale quick start topic. A difference you'll see this time is the Available Credits editor has a value of $50.00. This is telling us the client has $50.00 to use to apply to this sale.

3. Late last night, Pam formulated Poison Ivy's Miracle Tattoo Aftercare, specifically for Commissioner Gordon. She explains a couple of dabs on the new tattoo will heal it up in just hours, completely skipping the itching and peeling stages of a new tattoo. He's reluctant, however trusts she has turned over a new leaf. Add the item using the **Add Sale Item** action.

4. Click the **Take Payment** action. This time you will see a new tile showing available deposits/credits. You can chose to apply these deposits, or roll them forward if you're doing session work.

5. Click the **Deposits/credits** tile. This will present us with the deposits/credits the client has available. Click each deposit/credit tile you wish to apply (the client may have multiple deposits or credits available). If you wish to apply a partial deposit amount, you can change the amount field. If you leave the amount greater than what is available, it will authorize only the available amount. Click the **Apply Selected** tile.

After applying the deposit (or taking a payment), if there is still a balance, the New Payment window will open again. This time, you'll notice there are no deposits or credits to use. You can split the sale into as many payments as you need, for example, multiple credit cards, until the balance is zero.

6. The client will put it on his Visa card. Harley already set up her CardConnect account and and will click the **Credit Card** tile. If you have not yet set up your integrated processing account or are in a currently unsupported region, you can click the **Other** tile and select the card type.

7. The balance is now fully paid, and we can **Save & Close** the sale to wrap things up with a receipt and printed aftercare. Commissioner Gordon walks out a happy customer. For now...

When we printed out the release forms earlier, we noticed some changes we wanted to make. Since there is no one in the studio right now, we'll quickly take the time to make those changes in the next topic.
