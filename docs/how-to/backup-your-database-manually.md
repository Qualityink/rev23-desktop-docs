# How to: Backup your database (manually)

Ideally, you have configured the [Backup Service](../server-concepts/backup-service.md) take automatic backups for you. However, there are occasions where you need to take a backup manually. Part of a healthy backup strategy is to keep offsite backups, for example, backing up your database at the end of each week and taking it home with you. Manual backups can be useful if you're about to make a major change that you're unsure of how it will affect the system.

1) Open the [REV23 Desktop Control Panel](../server-concepts/control-panel.md).
2) Click the "Backup/Restore Database" tile.
3) Click the "Backup Database" button.
4) Choose a location to save the database to, and click "Save".

Depending on the size of your database this may take a few minutes or more to complete.
