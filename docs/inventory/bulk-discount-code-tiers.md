# Bulk Discount Code Tiers

### Properties

**Discount Percentage:** The discount percentage to apply to each matching item.

**Start Quantity:** The minimum quantity of items for this tier to be applied.

**End Quantity:** The maximum quantity of items for this tier to be applied before searching for the next tier.

**And Up:** If checked, the end quantity is infinite, meaning there are higher discount tiers after this.

## Connected Studio Behavior
A bulk discount code can exist in multiple studios. Instead of creating duplicate discount codes you should link to already existing discounts to each studio they apply to. Use the Link action in the Locations tab to add the code to additional studios.
