# Inventory Departments

Inventory Departments are a higher level group for your inventory item. The purpose of service departments are to group service types into similar groups rather than the hierarchical Inventory Categories.

The idea is not to create dozens of departments but to keep this list fairly small. When you want to do reporting on how much aftercare vs body jewelry you've sold, its much easier to visualize by department than drilling down category by category.
