# Inventory Categories

Inventory categories are like folders that you can use to sort your inventory items. You can create or edit inventory categories as needed. You can have a hierarchy of categories, meaning a parent category having one or more children subcategories, to efficiently organize your inventory items making things as easy to find as you'd like.

## Inventory Category Properties

**Name:** The name of the category.

**Parent Category:** The parent category. If a parent is specified, this category will be a subcategory of the parent. If no parent is specified, this category will be a root category.

> When creating a new Inventory Category from the Inventory Categories List View, if a node is selected at the time you click the New action, it will default the parent category to that value. If you wish to create a root category, clear this value by clicking the X button on the editor.

**Default Inventory Department:** If specified, any inventory items that are created in this category will have their department set to this value by default.

**Default Inventory Item Type:** Any inventory items that are created in this category will have their inventory item type set to this value by default.
