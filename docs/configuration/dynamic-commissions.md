# Dynamic Commissions

Dynamic Commissions, often referred to as sliding scale commissions, are an optional way to handle your artists commissions based on their the total revenue they have brought in for the week. They create an incentive for your artists to work all week long, bringing in as much revenue as they can, in order to increase their commission each week.

They work like this: You create a Dynamic Commission, and add tiers to it. Each tier represents a commission percentage, and the dollar range required to achieve that commission. As an artist begins tattooing for the week, they start at their base  commission. As the week progresses, the more tattoos they do, the higher the commission they can earn as they move through each tier. Once they enter a new tier, all of the week's previous tattoos will then adjust to reflect the new commission.

Finally, at the beginning of the week, they restart back at zero and will start over again.

> You can change the first day of the week that dynamic commissions use in your studio settings.

After creating a dynamic commission, you must set the Dynamic Commission property on each Service Type you wish the commission to apply to and additionally on each Employee you must set each of their Employee Service Types commission type to Dynamic.
