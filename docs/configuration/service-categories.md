# Service Categories

Service categories are like folders that you can use to sort your service types. You can create or edit service categories as needed. You can have a hierarchy of categories, meaning a parent category having one or more children subcategories, to efficiently organize your service types making things as easy to find as you'd wish.

# Service Category Properties

**Name:** The name of the category. The name is required.

**Parent Category:** The parent category. If a parent is specified, this category will be a subcategory of the parent. If no parent is specified, this category will be a root category.
> When creating a new Service Category from the Service Categories List View, if a node is selected at the time you click the New action, it will default the parent category to that value. If you wish to create a root category, clear this value by clicking the X button on the editor.

**Default Service Department:** If specified, any service types that are created in this category will have their department set to this value by default.
