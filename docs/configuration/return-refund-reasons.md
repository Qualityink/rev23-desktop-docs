# Return/Refund Reasons

Return/Refund reasons are text representations of reasons that a customer may have requested a return or refund so that you have a record of it, without having to type it in each time. These can be created, deleted and edited as necessary.

## Return/Refund Reason Properties

**Name:** The name of the return/refund reason. The name is required and must be unique.

**Require Reason Text:** If checked, when this object is selected as a return/refund reason during a return, an additional "reason" text box will appear where the user must type more specific information about the return/refund.
