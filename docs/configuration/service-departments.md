# Service Departments

Service Departments are a higher level group for your service types. The purpose of service departments are to group service types into similar groups rather than the hierarchical Service Categories.

The idea is not to create dozens of departments but to keep this list fairly small. They are most useful in shops that do tattoos and body piercing. This way all piercing service types could be added to the Piercing department. When looking at certain dashboards and reports you'll see a clear picture of Tattooing vs. Piercing instead of Tattooing vs. Ear Piercings vs. Genital Piercings.
