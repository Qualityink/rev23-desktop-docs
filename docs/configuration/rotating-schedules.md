# Rotating Schedules

Rotating schedules have two main purposes. The first is to allow your artists flexibility to have weekends off if desired. Additionally, they enable you to have more artists than you may possibly have stations in your studio making your shop more versatile and more profitable.

Imagine the following scenarios:

You have multiple artists that all want weekends off.
You have an artist that has an appointment every other Wednesday and isn't in the studio.
You have three tattoo stations in your studio but want to hire a fourth artist.

These problems and many more are easily solvable with rotating schedules.

How do they work?
On the surface rotating schedules may seem complicated, but they're actually quite simple. You create a rotating schedule, set a start date, which is any Sunday where the first week of the schedule will land, then define each week's schedule (1-4) and then assign the schedule to a user in their profile. Once assigned, the user's working hours on the scheduler will change week to week, allowing you to book your appointments for them easily and effectively without wondering "is this their day off?"

## Rotating Schedule Properties

**Name:** The name of the Rotating Schedule. The name is required and must be unique.

**Rotation Start Date:** The date this schedule's week 1 will begin. This date can be in the past, the present or even the future. The rotation start date is the Sunday on which Week 1 would fall. 
Note: Even if the date is in the future, the scheduler will still show this schedule when viewing past dates.

**Week Definitions:** Week definitions control a work week. You can add or delete them using the Week Definitions Nested List View.

## Rotating Schedule Week Definitions

**Week Number:** The week number this definition applies to. This property must be unique for each Rotating Schedule. The Rotation Start Date of the Rotation Schedule will use the Week 1 definition. Currently you configure up to four weeks. Have a need for more than four weeks? Congratulations! You're a scheduling master! Contact us and we'll be happy to add support for your scenario.

> If you have a schedule that rotates every other week, or third week, you do not need to specify a week definition for all weeks in the rotating schedule. You would only need to specify Week 1 and Week 2. REV23 Desktop will alternate these weeks throughout the rest of the schedule.
