# Styles

Styles represent various art styles that your artists are tattooing on clients. By assigning one or more styles to a tattoo service you can begin to develop an accurate picture of what your artists do the most of and which of those styles bring in the most revenue to the studio.

For example, a portrait of Marilyn Monroe could fall into a few styles, such as Celebrity, Portrait and possibly Black & Gray or Color depending on coloring choice.
