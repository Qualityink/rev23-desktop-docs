# Sources

Sources represent the various places that customers have heard about your business to want to come in and buy goods or services. By tracking the source your customer used to find you you can begin to develop an idea of where your advertising dollars are working and what strategies aren't paying off.

You should get specific with your sources. If you're running a radio promotion on multiple stations it makes sense to have each station created as a source to be able to track which one is working out the best. Perhaps, much to your surprise, you'll find you get more customers from the classical station than you do hard rock.
