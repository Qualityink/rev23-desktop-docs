# User Service Types (Employee Service Types)

User Service Types are records added to each of your artists that instruct REV23 Desktop which service types a user is able to perform and how they're paid for those service types.

For example, a user service type tells REV23 Desktop that Pam is a tattooer and receives a 50% commission for tattoos on clients.

Additionally you can set other values such as hourly rate, and a license number and expiration date so you can be warned if their license is nearing expiration.
