# Email Marketing

You can easily extract your email marketing list from REV23 Desktop for use in third-party email marketing services, such as [Constant Contact](http://www.constantcontact.com/index.jsp?pn=rev23dev).

To export your email marketing list:

1. Navigate to the **Customers** List View
2. Click the **File** menu.
3. Click the **Export Mailing List to CSV** action.
4. Select a path and click the **Save** button.

You now have a file of your customers ready to import into any email marketing service. You should repeat this process regularly to keep your email marketing service contact list up to date.

> REV23 Desktop cannot send emails for the purpose of email marketing directly and a third-party service is required for this activity.
