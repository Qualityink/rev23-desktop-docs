# Walkouts

Walkouts are records of lost potential customers. If someone comes into your studio and leaves without scheduling an appointment or getting tattooed/pierced, you should create a walkout to record this happened and eventually see trends to help you improve.

## Create a walkout

1. From the Quick Action toolbar, or the Tools tab on the Ribbon, click the **Record Walkout** action.
2. Select a **Reason** and click **OK**.
    > You can add additional Walkout Reasons using the New action in the lookup list view, or by navigating to [Configuration > Walkout Reasons](../configuration/walkout-reasons.md).

## How and why to analyze walkout data

You can view walkout data in Reports or Dashboards. After recording walkouts for a long enough period of time you may start to see trends. For example, you may see that a lot of people attempt to come in for walk-ins on Thursday evenings but there are no available artists at that time. By understanding this valuable data, you can make the appropriate change to your studio, perhaps by having one or two walk-in artists on those afternoons.
