# Services

Services represent a single instance of a customer being tattooed or pierced in your studio. This is arguably the most important piece of the REV23 Desktop core. Along with the record of the customer, the date and time, the service type and the employee, a service record stores the release form, commissions, and other valuable information. For each service that is performed, you need to create a service record. That means, if a customer is getting their lobes pierced, as well as a tongue piercing in the same session you will still need to create two individual service records.
