# Main Window

The screen that appears after you log on is the Main Window. The Main Window is how you interact with, and navigate through REV23 Desktop. The Main Window consists of the Ribbon, the Navigation Bar (containing Navigation Groups and Navigation Items), and in most cases, grids known as list views. However, there are some cases where the main window will display charts, detail views, or the scheduler. We'll go into each of these later.

## Actions

There are actions in the main window that aren't available in other views, they control the main window and/or global functions of REV23 Desktop.
