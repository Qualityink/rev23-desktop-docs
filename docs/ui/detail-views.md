# Detail Views

A detail view is a view in REV23 Desktop which displays a single object in your database such as a specific customer. A detail view will appear when creating a new object or editing an existing object.

Unlike the power of List Views, most Detail Views are fairly straight forward. However some can be complex with multiple tabs and buttons and actions in the Ribbon.


The Customer Detail View. Because of the large number of objects that can be associated with a customer's history (appointments, invoices, deposits, services, medical conditions, notes, etc... these nested list views appear in tabs in the detail view.)

Creating a new record
To create a new record, which will invoke the detail view for that object, go to the List View for that object type and click the New button. For example, to create a new customer, navigate to the Customer List View and click the New button. This will create a new record and show the detail view for you to enter data into.

Hint: Common objects (customers, invoices, gift cards, etc...) can be created from any list view by clicking the drop down button under the New button and selecting the desired object type from the popup menu.

Hint: Hit CTRL+N on your keyboard to create a new object. When you're in a list view, it will create a new object of that type.

Editing an existing record
To edit an existing record, find the desired record in the list view and double click it or hit the ENTER key on your keyboard.

Saving your changes in a detail view
After you've made changes to an object you'll obviously want to save those changes back to the database. 

Detail Views contain actions on the Ribbon specific for Detail Views located in the Home tab in the Save group. These actions are 'Save' and 'Save and Close'. The Save and Close action will ultimately be one of the most used actions in REV23 Desktop.

Use the Save action to save changes to the current record.
Use the Save and Close action to save changes to the current record and close this detail view, returning you to the previous screen.

Additionally, in some detail views you will see an action named Save and Clone. Use this action to save the current object and create a new object using the values from the saved object, like a copy. This is particularly helpful when creating inventory items.

Hint: Hit CTRL+S on your keyboard to save an object or CTRL+ENTER to save and close.

Canceling your changes in a detail view
If you've made changes that you don't wish to save you can execute the Cancel action in the ribbon, found in the Edit group, or you can close the window. If you attempt to close a window when changes are pending you will be prompted to save your changes or to discard them.


The cancellation prompt.
Printing a detail view
You can print a detail view by clicking the File Button on the ribbon and selecting the Print action. Note that unlike list views, no particular formatting is applied when printing and it will basically be printed as you see it on the screen.

Hint: Occasionally other specialized print items will appear in detail views, such as reprinting an invoice receipt or credit card receipt. These will have their own actions in the Application Button but will be visible next to the standard Print action.

## Actions

Detail View Actions
Along with common actions, detail views have specific actions that do not appear in list views. These actions apply to the current object for which the detail view is displayed.

Save Actions

Save

The Save action saves the changes you've made to the current object to the database.

Save and Close

The Save and Close action saves the changes you've made to the current object to the database and closes the detail view.

Save and Clone

The Save and Clone action (available only for certain objects) saves the changes you've made to the current object to the database and creates a clone of the object in a new detail view.

Edit Actions

Cancel

The Cancel action cancels the changes you've made to the current object and restores its values from the database.

Close Actions

Close

The Close action closes the detail view. If you have pending changes, you will be prompted to save or discard them.
