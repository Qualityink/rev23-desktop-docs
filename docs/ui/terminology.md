# UI Terminology

There are several important elements that make up the REV23 Desktop user interface, which will sometimes be referred to as the UI. The following topics will explain what those elements are, the terminology that will be used in this user guide, how to use those elements as well as how to customize their appearance.

> Due to the constant evolution of REV23 Desktop, screenshots in this user guide may not appear exactly as you see them on your screen. Features are regularly added and changed which occasionally modifies the user interface before we've had a chance to update the user guide.

In this brief topic, we will talk about the terminology we use to refer to different areas of the user interface. Understanding this terminology will be valuable as you go through these docs.
 
## UI
Short hand for user interface.
 
## Main Window 
The primary UI of REV23 Desktop. This window is where you will switch between area's of the software, generally to different list views.
 
## Navigation Bar
Appearing only in the main window, the navigation bar provides access to grouped items that you will use to navigate around the software.
 
## Ribbon
The ribbon is the tabbed toolbar on top of most windows, including the main window and most detail views. This provides access to various actions.
 
## Action
A clickable control that performs some action, generally having the appearance of a button that is located on the ribbon and sometimes in detail views. Because they're not always a button, but sometimes a selector or other control, they're called actions, however we may refer to them occasionally as buttons if it makes more sense in the context.
 
## List View
A list view is a collection of data, presented in a list format in a powerful grid. For example, a list of your customers.
 
## Column
A column vertical (up & down) data in a list view. For example, the First Name property in the Customer list view.
 
## Row
A row is horizontal (left & right) data in a list view. For example, one single and specific customer in the Customer list view.
 
## Detail View
A detail view is a separate window from the main window which presents the data of a single object. For example, double clicking a row in the Customer list view will open that customer's detail view. This is where you will edit that record's data such as entering a first and last name.
 
## Property
A property of the object in a detail view. For example, the First Name of a customer.
 
## Editor
An editor is a control which allows you to edit a property of an object. For example a text editor will allow you to type text such as a customer's first and last name, while a date editor will present a calendar for you to pick a date for a birthday.
 
## Nested List View
A nested list view is a list view that appears inside of a detail view to represent a collection of objects related to the detail view. For example, a list of services a customer has received at your studio. Nested list views have their own toolbars with specific actions such as deleting an object from that list.
 
## Lookup List View
A lookup list view is a small list view that appears as a result of clicking some editors. They are used for selecting other objects in your database to link to the record. For example, when selecting a customer for a service, when clicking the "Customer" editor, you will be shown a small version of the Customer list view to select the customer who will be receiving the service.
