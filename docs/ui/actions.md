# Actions

Actions are clickable controls, generally buttons, but not always which perform a particular action. The most common actions you will use in REV23 Desktop are the New action, which will create a new record, and the Save & Close action, which will save the current record to the database and close that record's detail view.
 
Some common actions appear mostly everywhere. Other actions may be specific to the type of object you're working with.
 
Some actions may only appear in list views. See List View Actions.

Some actions may only appear  in detail views. See Detail View Actions.
 
Some actions are specific to a particular type of object. These actions will be called out in their own topics. For example, see Customer Actions for actions that are specific to working with customer data. Or Main Window Actions that only appear in the REV23 Desktop Main Window.
