# Add-on PCs

The Add-on PC installer is an additional setup package for add-on PCs you have in your studio, in an additional studio, or at home. The Add-on PC installer only installs the REV23 Desktop application (client) that will connect to a database that is hosted on the computer where the Server installer was installed.

Add-on PC's must be the same version as the server version. If you update one you will have to update the other in order for things to work properly.

Find out more about setting up add-on PCs in the Add-on PCs topic.

> There is no trial version of the Add-on PC installer.
