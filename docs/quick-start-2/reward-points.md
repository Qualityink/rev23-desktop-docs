# Quick Start Vol 2: Reward points

The referral program seems to be helping drive traffic into the studio, and Gotham's citizens are finally starting to accept the girl's new venture and receiving some awesome tattoos and piercings. Harley wants to reward her loyal customers by enabling Reward Points. By doing so, for each purchase, a client will receive points. Once enough points have been earned, they will automatically convert into a credit that can be used just like a deposit or referral credit.
