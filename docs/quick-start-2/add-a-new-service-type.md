# Quick Start Vol 2: Add a new service type

Unfortunately, many of the tattoos that exist in Gotham City were performed by some less than reputable sources. Harley thinks adding a removal service will be beneficial, so they can start making room for some better pieces on their new clientele. Tattoo removal comes in a variety of forms these days, but the girls know from experience, when you want a tattoo removed there is no better way than their magical acquaintance, Zatanna!

Since removal is neither really tattooing, nor piercing, we will first create a brand new department and category for this service type. The steps below will seem slightly longer than some previous categories only because we are first going to create these two new objects first, then create the new Service Type.

You will need to be logged on as the Administrator or a Manager to proceed with this topic.

1. Navigate to Configuration -> Service Departments.

2. Click the New action to create a new Service Department and open the Service Department Detail View. 

3. Type a name for the department, we'll use Tattoo Removal.

4. Save & Close the Service Department Detail View to return to the Service Department List View.

5. Navigate to Configuration -> Service Categories.

6. Click an empty area in the window to deselect any category that may already be selected, and click the New action to create a new service category and open the Service Category Detail View.

    > Hint: If you have a category selected in the tree view before clicking the New action, the newly created category will have the selected category set as its Parent Category, making this a subcategory. In this case, we want our new category to be at the root level, meaning it has no parent. If the Parent Category is already set when the detail view opens, you can click the X button on the right hand side of the Parent Category editor to clear it.

7. Specify a name in the Name editor. We'll call it Tattoo Removal.

8. Click the Default Service Department editor to show the Service Department Lookup List View. Select the department we created in the previous step.

9. Save & Close the Service Category Detail View to return to the Service Categories Tree View.

10. Navigate to Configuration ->  Service Types.

11. In the Category tree list on the left hand side of the Service Type List View select our newly created Tattoo Removal category.

12. Click the New action to create a new Service Type and open a Service Type Detail View. Take note of two things:

 Because we has selected the category before we clicked the New action, the category is already set.
 Because when we created the category in the previous step and set the Default Service Department property, the Department property is already set.
