# Database

The REV23 Desktop Database is where your data is stored. When you open the REV23 Desktop client on either the main PC or an add-on PC, the data you read, save and delete is coming to and from the database. It is important to note that the REV23 Desktop database is stored on the server and not the cloud. **It is your responsibility to ensure that your database is backed up, and that those backups are safe. We provide tools for you to do this either automatically or manually.**

For the most part, you do not need to worry about the database itself, and only need to concern yourself with the backups.
