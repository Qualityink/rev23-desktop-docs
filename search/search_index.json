You're about to begin learning how to use REV23 Desktop! Whether you're evaluating REV23 Desktop or have already made up your mind and signed up, I'm happy you're here with us. You're on the road to implementing a level of automation in your tattoo and/or body piercing business that you've never dreamed was possible. Keep in mind that to accomplish this level of automation, setup is required and in some cases this can be time consuming to get right. Getting up and running with REV23 Desktop is not as effortless as installing software such as iTunes or Instagram. Figuring it out by just poking around isn't going to happen. Sure you could get close and find a flow that works for you, but you'd miss a lot. Time and thought as well as dedication need to go into configuring the elements of REV23 Desktop in order to get the most out of it. You will not be sorry that you've taken the time to configure the software and begin experiencing a truly automated shop! If you're unwilling to make this commitment then turn back now. I don't want you to be dissatisfied with your decision and would rather have you using another product than be unhappy with us. To be as successful as possible with REV23 Desktop, I recommend reading this user guide before you even install the software. Okay, stop laughing and/or groaning. Seriously, this is the best way to see what REV23 Desktop has to offer, and more importantly, it will get you to start thinking about how REV23 Desktop will fit in your business. This way, you have a general idea of how you will want to configure things to best suit your needs and have a good understanding of where you're going when you get into the software for the first time. Next, I recommend keeping an open mind about how you run your business as you go through this user guide. Professional tattooing in the United States dates back to 1846. As time has passed, business practices have evolved. For some of you, this may be your first time going from the traditional pen and paper bookkeeping to a software product like REV23 Desktop. Or perhaps you've decided to switch to REV23 Desktop from another product that didn't quite suit your needs. In either case, REV23 Desktop has been designed for what we believe are the best practices in this industry, gathered from the collective knowledge of our many users and our own usage. This may not naturally fit into how you do things. This doesn't mean you're wrong. Maybe you're a trend setter. Perhaps what you're doing is genius. If that's the case, we'd love to hear about it and see how we can support it. But perhaps you're using methods that have created complexities for you that are unnecessary. So, if you don't see how your process can fit in, think about that process, why it's necessary for you and see if the REV23 Desktop way makes a little more sense to implement. If you are stuck somewhere, send us an email at support@rev23.com and we\u2019ll be happy to help. Good luck and please let us know what you think. REV23 Desktop has evolved because of users like you.

Aftercare can be printed from a service, sale, or emailed automatically to the customer by the Virtual Receptionist after a service has been completed. It is recommended you familiarize yourself with the Templates topic before proceeding with this topic. Customizing Aftercare Forms Navigate to Configuration > Templates . Select a built-in aftercare form template provided by REV23. Click the Clone action to create your own copy. Click the Show Template Designer action. Make your desired changes in the Template Designer and save. Navigate to Configuration > Service Types . Double click a Service Type record that you wish to apply your new aftercare template to. Set the Aftercare Form property to your new template. Click the Save & Close action to save the Service Type. This service type will now use the selected template. Repeat steps 7-9 for each service type you wish to use this aftercare template. It's important to note that you do not need to create a separate aftercare form for each individual service type. Any property that exists on the service type, such as Healing Time, can be merged into the aftercare form template, so in most cases, you can reuse the same template across multiple service types such as all of your piercings. If you wish to create an empty template for your aftercare form rather than cloning an existing one, aftercare forms require a Template with the Data Type of Service . Emailing Aftercare Forms The Virtual Receptionist can email aftercare forms to your customers after a service is completed. An email will be sent to the customer containing a body, and a PDF attachment of the aftercare form. Navigate to Configuration > Virtual Receptionist . Ensure that the Email Aftercare Instructions workflow is active. This workflow will execute automatically for customers that have an email address for any service that has an End On time set and has ended within the last 24 hours. (Read: The service must have an end time set for this workflow to execute.) If you wish to disable this feature, simply deactivate the Email Aftercare Instructions workflow. Customize the Email Subject You can customize the subject of the email that is sent in Configuration > Custom Texts by modifying the custom text with key name WORKFLOW_AFTERCARE_EMAIL_SUBJECT . Customize the Email Body The body that is sent in the email is a template which you can customize. The template that is used for the email body can be changed in Configuration > Virtual Receptionist Options in the Email Aftercare Instructions Email Options tab. By default this is the template with key name REV23_AFTERCARE_EMAIL_BODY , and is recommended you clone that template if you wish to change this text. The email body should not contain your aftercare instructions, but a more general email along the lines of \" Thank you for coming in to Gotham City Tattoo & Piercing, attached are the aftercare instructions for your new tattoo. \" Printing Aftercare Forms You can print an aftercare form from a Service by clicking the Print Aftercare action. Additionally, you can be prompted to print aftercare instructions after a sale containing one or more services has been fully paid.

In the Server field, type or copy-and-paste the calendar link. iOS Auto Fetch By default, iOS will only sync the calendar manually. To automatically sync,go to Settings, tap \"Passwords & Accounts\", tap \"Fetch New Data\", and select the desired interval under the \"Fetch\" settings.

While used the same, there are slight differences in how these different types behave and how they're created, but they both have the same goal, to reduce the balance of a sale. Each deposit/credit has a customer, as well as a starting balance. Credits A credit is money that exists on a customer account that can be used towards the purchase of a tattoo, piercing or retail item. They can be created manually in the Deposits & Credits list view, or more commonly issued as part of a refund as an in-store credit. Deposits Deposits behave similar to credits with one key difference, in order to be created, the customer must make a payment in exchange for the deposit. Deposits can be created manually in the Deposits & Credits list view if it is floating (it does not have an appointment associated with it), or more commonly created as part of creating an appointment. Reward Credits Reward credits are the same as credits with the exception that they are only created automatically by the Points system. Reward credits cannot be created manually. Deposit/Credit History Each deposit/credit has a list of history items (found in the History tab). Each history item has an adjustment amount which alters the Available Balance of the deposit/credit. For instance, If a deposit started at $200, a history item of Funds Removed with an adjustment amount of $50 , would reduce the Available Balance to $150. You can manually create history items to adjust the balance as needed, but more commonly they will be created in a few ways. Redeeming all or part of a deposit/credit on a sale. Forfeiting a deposit/credit. For example, when a customer doesn't show up for an appointment. Tipping an artist. The customer may choose to a remaining balance of their deposit as a tip for the artist. Deposit Policy The Deposit Policy is a custom text that appears on the deposit receipt. You can customize this text by navigating to Configuration > Custom Texts and altering the custom text with key name DEPOSIT_POLICY . Deposit Agreement You can optionally require a customer to sign a deposit agreement, using the signature pad, when taking a deposit with the Sign Deposit Agreement action. The deposit agreement provides the user with your defined terms of the deposit (such as no refunds or any other policies you have) and forces them to acknowledge and agree to them, they then provide their signature. The signature is stored in the database and printed on the deposit/credit receipt. The text which appears on the signature pad that the customer must first acknowledge is defined by custom text using the SIGNATURE_PAD_DEPOSIT_AGREEMENT key name.

You can payout cash nightly, write checks weekly, payout individual services. Each method will be covered in its own topic. Service Payouts On occasion, you may find it necessary to selectively payout one (or a few) individual services or their tips. Perhaps the artist received a large tip today, or they need an advance to repair their car before their check that you're willing to help them out on by paying them out cash, or cutting them a check for what they've earned. To accomplish this, open the detail view for the desired service and use the Payout Employee action. Check Payouts Cash Payouts Cash payouts in REV23 Desktop are an optional payout method for shops that like to payout cash nightly to their artists. The cash payout feature looks at several factors when determining what amount each artist can be paid in cash and there are some settings that you can use to customize it to your needs. Cash payouts are actually incredibly simple to do and a highlight feature of REV23 Desktop, so don't let the length of this topic fool you into thinking it's complicated. It is important that you understand how they're being calculated in the background so you can explain to your artists why they're receiving the amount of cash they're receiving. How cash payouts are calculated? Because REV23 Desktop uses some advanced formulas to calculate cash distribution, it may not always be obvious what it is doing. But you can trust that its behaving as designed. At a high level, we look at Services and Deposits (if you advance deposits to your artists) that were paid in cash each day. On the surface, and for the most basic scenarios, this works exactly as you'd expect it to. A $200 tattoo at 50% commission, paid all in cash, the artist is eligible for $100 cash, their entire commission, or $50 cash, depending on your Default Cash Payout Mode setting in your studio's invoicing & payment options). However, take into account when a deposit is used to reduce the balance. That same $200 tattoo with a $125 deposit, with the remaining $75 paid in cash. In this case there isn't enough cash in the drawer to payout the full commission, so it will payout what it can. And imagine an even more complex scenario, in which a husband and wife are tattooed by separate artists, deposits are used, some aftercare is purchased, they put some on credit card, maybe some on a gift card, and pay with a little bit of cash. Who gets what part of the small amount of cash here? A real head scratcher, right? Not for REV23 Desktop. In short, Cash Payouts only look at the cash portion of the transaction. It then sets aside retail sales and tax, leaving behind only what should be split amongst services. It then determines the amount each artist is able to claim, using their percentage of the total invoice amount, and splits it proportionally, then rounds down to the nearest dollar so you're not attempting to split change, leaving their remaining commission for a check payout. As a result of this method, you'll often see some numbers that might not make sense at first glance. When you run into a question such as \"why am I paying out $22.00 in cash to Dave on a $500.00 tattoo when his commission is 60%?\" you can trust that it's simply because that's all the cash there was to hand out for that particular transaction. REV23 Desktop ensures that you aren't paying out more cash than is in the drawer. In your studio's Invoicing & Payment Options there is a \"Default Cash Payout Mode\" setting which controls how cash is paid out. You can read more about it in the invoicing & payment options topic. Paybacks Paybacks are money that an employee owes back to the studio. These can happen for two reasons. First, deposit advances that were paid out will be paid back when the deposit is used so that the artist isn't paid twice for that deposit. Paybacks also occur if a return/refund has occurred and the commission that was paid out will be recollected. Payouts vs Payroll For a variety of reasons, we do not include, nor plan to include full payroll features in REV23 Desktop. We easily provide you with your artist's and employee's gross pay information based on their commissions on services, sales, deposits, etc... as well as hourly rate that you can pass over to an accounting software package or your accountant, but we do not calculate payroll taxes or print payroll checks. Here's the main reason: products like QuickBooks pretty much have this area covered and are trusted solutions. Breaking character of \"anonymous user manual guy\" and speaking as the developer of REV23 Desktop, I wouldn't personally trust packages outside of true accounting packages like QuickBooks to deal with this. We're aware of the fact that some competitors offer these features, but our tax system (at least in the United States) is complex. Tax laws change, updates have to be made yearly, etc... this is a maintenance nightmare for us and not an area we're planning on exploring. On top of ever changing laws, you need a particular certification to be \"accounting software\". This is not something we're interested in. My advice is to use true accounting software or an accountant for payroll.","title":"Payouts"},{"location":"concepts/payouts/#payouts","text":"Payouts in REV23 Desktop are flexible to your needs.

Usage A customer is issued points for each dollar they spend. Most commonly, for every dollar spent, they will earn one point, though you can override this per item or service type to issue a specific amount of points for these items. When enough points have been earned to redeem a credit, they will be cashed out and new reward credit will be added to the customer's profile to be used just like a normal deposit or credit. Set up Navigate to Configuration > My Studio . Click the Options tab. Click the Rewards tab. Check the Enable Points checkbox to turn on points. Set a Point Conversion Rate . This is the value of a single point in relation to one dollar. For example, 5% is equal to $0.05. Set the Auto Redeem Points Threshold . This is the dollar amount when a customer has earned enough points to be cashed in for a reward credit. For example, once the customer has enough points to issue $5.00 that's the point in which the points will cash out and convert to a credit. A calculated property, Points Required To Redeem will display showing you how many points a customer will need to earn before the credit can be issued. Examples Point Conversion Rate Auto Redeem Points Threshold Points Required Description 5% $5.00 100 When the client spends $100, they will earn $5.00 in credits. Point Types & Overriding Points While the most common scenario is for a customer to earn one point for every one dollar spent (point type of Subtotal), you can customize this to fit your needs or run promotions, such as double points day (Subtotal multiple of two).

In-place Reports In-place reports are not generally not meant to be run by the user, but will be generated at various points in the workflow for a specific object. The invoice receipt, credit card authorization receipt and deposit/credit receipt are all examples of in-place reports. Additionally, where an in-place report exists for a particular object type, you will see the Show In Report action which will allow you to generate a report for the selected object. Reports (Legacy) Reports that have yet to be upgraded to our current version of reporting, including old custom reports, will be found in the Reports (Legacy) navbar item.

Our studio is open 7 days a week, Sunday through Saturday. Each of the artists want weekends off. This is easily solvable with a rotating schedule. On week 1, Dave will have Saturday and Sunday off. Mike will have Monday and Tuesday off, and Casey will have Wednesday and Thursday off. On week 2, Dave will have Monday and Tuesday off, Mike will have Wednesday and Thursday off, and Casey will have Saturday and Sunday off. On week 3, Dave will have Wednesday and Thursday off, Mike will have Saturday and Sunday off, and Casey will have Monday and Tuesday off. We want everyone in on Friday because it's our busiest day. Every fourth week our schedule will start over again to week 1. To accomplish this scenario we will need three rotating schedules, each one assigned to one of the artists. Each schedule will have a start date one week apart from each other. We will also have three week definitions in each schedule. These week definitions will be identical in each schedule. The reason for this is in this scenario our schedule is exactly the same hours, we just want each of them to start on a different week creating the pattern we need. Set it up We will setup some rotating schedules to solve the \"I want weekends off!\" dilemma. Create a new Rotating Schedule and name it \"Artist Schedule 1\". Set the rotation start date to any Sunday (past, present, future, it doesn't matter) where you want the first week to begin. We'll pick December 1st, 2013. Create a new Week Definition for the schedule in the nested list view. Set the week number to Week 1. Set the hours, in this case we'll set it to work every day except Saturday and Sunday. Create a new Week Definition for Week2, and set it to work every day except Monday and Tuesday. Create a new Week Definition for Week 3, and set it to work every day except Wednesday and Thursday. Clone the schedule In our example, we want each artist to use this same schedule, we just be offset by a single week. This is easy to accomplish. In the Rotation Schedule List View, Clone Artist Schedule 1. Change the name to \"Artist Schedule 2\". 2. Set the rotation start date to be the Sunday after Artist Schedule 3. Save the new schedule. Now we have two versions of the same rotating schedule, but they both start one week apart from each other. We can now repeat those three steps for Artist Schedule 3 and we'll have three versions of the same schedule that we can assign to one artist each. Assign the schedule to a user Navigate to Security > Employees and open the detail view for the artist you'd like to use Artist Schedule 1. Set their Rotating Schedule Group to Artist Schedule 1 and save their record. Repeat this for the artist that will use Artist Schedule 2 and Artist Schedule 3. Now, when you're scheduling appointments you'll always be able to easily tell if that is an artist's day off without guessing or trying to do head math. Conclusion This is one example of many useful scenarios for rotating schedules. You could have a single user that needs every other Monday off to deal with personal matters. One rotating schedule with two week definitions will do the trick. Additionally if you wanted to bring in a fourth artist to our scenario above but you only have three stations you could tighten the days, so one artist has Saturday and Sunday off and another has Sunday and Monday off, rather than Monday and Tuesday, etc... this would allow you to fit an extra artist in the schedule as a station would be empty every day of the week. Rotating schedules are very flexible and can allow you to create very complex or basic schedules.

While the Template Designer contains many features commonly found in a word processing application, such as formatting, tables and more, they are outside the scope of these docs. If you would like assistance laying out your template, please feel free to contact REV23 support. To show the template designer for a template, highlight the desired template in the Template List View and click the Show Template Designer action. Fields When designing a template, you are creating a document that represents a single data object. For example, one service. Fields are special blocks that can be inserted into your template to act as placeholders for properties from that object. When you generate your template, fields will read data from that object and insert it into your template as text, an image, or even bar codes and check boxes. For example, when creating a consent form template for a service you would obviously want some key information that is populated when the consent form is generated such as the client's name, the date, etc... these can all be inserted as fields. Fields are accessed via the Data Explorer pane, which by default is located on the right of the document. Data Explorer The Data Explorer shows all available properties from the template's data type. At the root (top) of the data explorer you will see the object type assigned to the template. Underneath the root, you will see each of the properties of that object type. Some may expand with a [+] symbol next to each level. You can keep expanding each property until you reach the data you're looking for. For example, if the template has a data type of service, you will see the Service object at the top level. Underneath you will see properties such as Customer and Service Type which are separate objects of their own. Expanding the Customer property by clicking the [+] button will reveal the properties of a customer, such as their name, phone numbers, birthday, etc... Adding fields to a document To add a field from the Data Explorer to the document, either place their caret where you want to insert the data in the document, then double click the field, or click and drag the field from the data explorer to the document where you'd like to place it. Field Properties Each field has its own set of options. The most important of these is the format string, meaning you can change how the field is displayed. For example, a date & time such as 10/30/2014 3:08 PM. Depending on how we want to layout our template, the time may not be relevant, leaving only 10/30/2014, or only the time might be relevant, leaving 3:08 PM. You may also want to format them with a long date, such as \"Thursday, October 30, 2014\". All of this is easily achievable. First, the field has to have already been added to the document. Next, click on the field (in document) to highlight it. You'll be taken to the Field ribbon page. On that page there is a Properties popup menu which allows you to configure the field. Click the ellipsis button [...] on the Format String text box to invoke the format string editor. There, you can change the format to any standard type, or select a custom format. When you're done, click OK and the field will be formatted. See the Date/Time Format Codes topic for more information. Data Preview If data exists for the data type you're editing a template for, when a field is placed in the document, you'll see a random record's data as a preview. This assists in helping you layout your templates by showing real data. The space that <<Customer.Birthday>> takes up is much less than 10/31/1976 . If no data exists for that particular field, however, you'll see a place holder, such as <<Customer.Birthday>> .

Please note this if for hourly employees, not tattoo artists doing hourly work. There are only three two options for the time clock, which make it one of the easiest features to use in REV23 Desktop. For employees that you wish to use the time clock, you need to only set the \"Enable clock-in/clock-out\" setting in their profile from the Employee Detail View. You can optionally set the employee's hourly rate if you wish to have REV23 Desktop calculate their pay, or you can just track the hours worked and calculate their pay manually. You can run the Time Clock Detail report to easily acquire this information. When the time clock is enabled for a user, after they log on with their password they will be prompted if they would like to make an adjustment to their time card. This prompt will appear slightly different depending on their current status. Clocking-in If a user is clocked out, once they log on with their password they will be prompted to clock-in. This will put them on the clock and track their time until they clock-out. To clock in, the user can chose one of three options. Clock-in & log on: Creates a new time card entry with the current date & time and REV23 Desktop will continue to the Main Window. The user can use REV23 Desktop as usual. This option is only visible if the user has been assigned one or more Roles. Clock-in only: Creates a new time card entry with the current time, however REV23 Desktop will return to the log on screen. Log on only: Does not modify the time card and will show the main window. The user can use REV23 Desktop as usual. This option is only visible if the user has been assigned one or more Roles. Clocking-out If a user is clocked in, once they log on with their password they will be prompted to clock-out. This will end their current time entry and stop tracking their time. To clock out, the user can chose one of two options. Note: If the user is currently using REV23 Desktop they will need to log off, then log on again with their password in order to clock out. This is done so other users cannot clock-out a user and makes the process password protected. Clock-out: Modifies the user's current time card and sets the clock out time to the current date & time and REV23 Desktop will return to the log on screen. Log on only: Does not modify the time card and will show the main window. The user can use REV23 Desktop as usual. This option is only visible if the user has been assigned one or more Roles. Editing Time Clock Entries It's inevitable. From time to time your users will forget to clock in or out when they were supposed to. Here's how to fix this common scenario. Each time entry record consists of two values, the Clocked-in Date/Time and the Clocked-out Date/Time. Any entry without a clocked-out value is considered \"on the clock\". There can only be one \"on the clock\" entry per user, meaning you cannot create a new time entry record if the user is on the clock, they must be clocked out first. User forgot to clock-in Go to the Time Clock List view, create a new Time Entry using the New action. Set the employee and the clocked-in date/time property to the necessary value. User clocked-in late Go to the Time Clock List View. Locate the record and modify the clocked-in date/time property to the necessary value. Tip: Use the \"On the clock now\" list view filter to quickly locate the record by looking at only time entries that are currently clocked-in. User forgot to clock-out Go to the Time Clock List View.

For employees that you wish to use the time clock, you need to only set the \"Enable clock-in/clock-out\" setting in their profile from the Employee Detail View. You can optionally set the employee's hourly rate if you wish to have REV23 Desktop calculate their pay, or you can just track the hours worked and calculate their pay manually. You can run the Time Clock Detail report to easily acquire this information. When the time clock is enabled for a user, after they log on with their password they will be prompted if they would like to make an adjustment to their time card. This prompt will appear slightly different depending on their current status.","title":"Time Clock"},{"location":"concepts/time-clock/#clocking-in","text":"If a user is clocked out, once they log on with their password they will be prompted to clock-in.

REV23 Desktop interprets this code and replaces it with the date time value to the specified format. For example, if the code is yyyyMMdd and the date to be formatted is March 14, 2013, REV23 Desktop will replace this value with 20130314.

They create an incentive for your artists to work all week long, bringing in as much revenue as they can, in order to increase their commission each week. They work like this: You create a Dynamic Commission, and add tiers to it. Each tier represents a commission percentage, and the dollar range required to achieve that commission. As an artist begins tattooing for the week, they start at their base commission. As the week progresses, the more tattoos they do, the higher the commission they can earn as they move through each tier. Once they enter a new tier, all of the week's previous tattoos will then adjust to reflect the new commission. Finally, at the beginning of the week, they restart back at zero and will start over again. Note: You can change the first day of the week that dynamic commissions use in your studio settings. After creating a dynamic commission you must set the Dynamic Commission property on each Service Type you wish the commission to apply to and additionally on each Employee you must set each of their Employee Service Types commission type to Dynamic. Properties Name: The name of the dynamic commission. The name is required and must be unique. Dynamic Commission Mode: The behavior to use when calculating a dynamic commission tier. Day : The target values must be accomplished in a single day. Services for that day will all adjust their commission to the appropriate tier. These totals will reset at the end of each working day. Week to Date : Target values must be accomplished in a single week. Services for that week will all adjust their commission to the appropriate tier. These totals will reset at the end of each week. Week Forward : Target values must be accomplished in a single week. Service commissions will only adjust to the new commission going forward for the week, rather than adjusting each previous service. These totals will reset at the end of each week. Tiers: The tiers nested list view is used to create or edit tiers within this Dynamic Commission. Dynamic Commission Tiers Commission Percentage: The commission percentage that will be earned for all services during the week once the artist enters this tier. Start Amount: The beginning amount of the range for this tier. When creating a new dynamic commission, you will always want a tier that starts at a zero amount. Each tier's start amount should be one cent (0.01) greater than the previous tier's end amount. The start amount is required to be greater than or equal to zero. End Amount: The high end of the range for this tier. The end amount is required to be greater than zero only when the And Up setting is unchecked. If the And Up property is checked, this value will be zero and disabled. And Up: If checked, this will act as the last tier in the dynamic commission. If they clear this value there is no higher commission that can be earned. It is the equivalent of verbally saying \"$3,000+\" or \"$3,000 and up.\"","title":"Dynamic Commissions"},{"location":"configuration/dynamic-commissions/#dynamic-commissions","text":"Dynamic Commissions, often referred to as sliding scale commissions, are an optional way to handle your artists commissions based on their the total revenue they have brought in for the week.

Once they enter a new tier, all of the week's previous tattoos will then adjust to reflect the new commission. Finally, at the beginning of the week, they restart back at zero and will start over again. Note: You can change the first day of the week that dynamic commissions use in your studio settings. After creating a dynamic commission you must set the Dynamic Commission property on each Service Type you wish the commission to apply to and additionally on each Employee you must set each of their Employee Service Types commission type to Dynamic.","title":"Dynamic Commissions"},{"location":"configuration/dynamic-commissions/#properties","text":"Name: The name of the dynamic commission.

Week to Date : Target values must be accomplished in a single week. Services for that week will all adjust their commission to the appropriate tier. These totals will reset at the end of each week. Week Forward : Target values must be accomplished in a single week. Service commissions will only adjust to the new commission going forward for the week, rather than adjusting each previous service.

There are many options in the Location that control how you want REV23 Desktop to behave in your studio. REV23 Desktop supports business models that have multiple studios either in close proximity or across the country. If you have multiple studios you can chose to have them each have their own separate database, or share a single database. If shared, you will have some additional elements in the user interface to allow for location aware data. The Location Detail View (accessible for the studio you're currently logged into from the My Studio item in the Configuration navbar group) contains the basic information for your studio such as the name, phone number, address, etc... as well as a variety of options that control the behavior of REV23 Desktop. Main Name: The name of your studio. You can use the same name for multiple studios however you should use a name that is easy for you to identify each one.

Use business hours when running reports: If checked, reports will use your actual business hours when filtering start and end dates. This is useful if you close after midnight and want those services to be counted for the previous calendar date. Running reports with this enabled will create a very strict time frame. For example, if you run a report for a Friday and you're open 12:00 PM to 10:00 PM, it will look for things that occurred between exactly those times. If something occurred at 10:02 PM, it will not show up on the report. Alternatively with this option turned off, reports run from 12:00 AM - 11:59 PM on the specified day. First Day Of Week: Specifies the first day of your studio's work week. This is used for various reporting, including dynamic commissions.

See Date/Time Format Codes for more information about Invoice Number and Service Number Date/Time Formats. This property is only visible if the Service Number Generation Type is set to Date/Time. Gift Card Options Gift Card Points Type : The way points are earned for gift card purchases. See Points for more information on how points are earned and redeemed. None : No points are awarded to a customer when purchasing or redeeming a gift card. Subtotal : Points are awarded to a customer based on the subtotal. For example, a 200.00 gift card will earn 200.00 points. Subtotal Multiple: Points are awarded to a customer based on the subtotal then multiplied by the Gift Card Points Subtotal Multiple property. For example a 200.00 gift card with a subtotal multiplier of 2 will earn 400.00 points. Custom : The amount of points awarded is the static value in the Gift Card Points Custom property. For example, a 200.00 gift card with a custom value of 1 will earn 1 point. Gift Card Points Subtotal Multiple : The multiplier to apply to gift card points when the Gift Card Points Type is set to Subtotal Multiple. Note: This property is only visible if the Gift Card Points Type is not set to Subtotal Multiple. Gift Card Points Custom : The static point value for each gift card when the Gift Card Points Type is set to Custom. This property is only visible if the Gift Card Points Type is not set to Custom. Default Gift Card Point Application Type : The person who will earn points when a gift card is purchased or redeemed. This option can be overridden for each gift card sold. For example, if your default setting is to award the purchaser of the gift card points that is what will be used when you create a new gift card. However, lets say the mother of a friend of the studio comes in to buy a gift card, you may decide to give the points to the friend of the studio, rather than his mother who may never be back in. None : Neither party earns points when a gift card is purchased or redeemed. Purchaser : The customer who purchased the gift card will earn points at the time the gift card is purchased. Redeemer : The customer who received the gift card as a gift will earn points at the time they use the gift card.

If unchecked, all gift cards are automatically active when they're created. Inventory Options Default Sales Tax: The default sales tax to use when creating new sellable location inventory items. Barcode Prefix: If defined, the automatically generated barcode for inventory items will start with this text. It can be used to easily identify a barcode as being from a particular studio if you have multiple studios. This property can be a number, or even a short bit of text. For example, the barcode prefix of 1 will generate a barcode of 1000001 when an item is first created. You could use a string such as REV23 which would generate REV23000001. This should still be readable by the barcode scanner when printed, but it shouldn't be too long. Reuse barcodes from my other studios when available: If checked, and you have a connected studio license, when you add an inventory item to this studio that already exists in another it will use an existing Location Inventory Item barcode if available. Sales & Payments Options Sales Receipt: The report definition of the receipt you'd like to print as a receipt for the customer. Sales Receipt Printing Prompt: The behavior that will be used when REV23 Desktop would prompt you to print an invoice (sale) receipt after it has been paid.

Print : The document will automatically be sent to the default printer for this document type when it is ready. Skip : You will not be prompted to print this document and it will not print automatically. If you'd like to print it you will have to print it manually from the Application Button. This setting, as well as the 'Aftercare Printing Prompt' setting, located in Service Options, are somewhat dependent on each other. Regardless of the 'Skip' or 'Print' value here, if the Aftercare Printing Prompt is set to 'Prompt', you will still see the dialog asking if you would like to print, giving you the ability to optionally print the invoice receipt. In this scenario, if this setting is 'Print', the option to print the receipt will be checked by default, if it is set to 'Skip', the option to print the receipt will not be checked by default. Default Invoice Discount Payout Adjustment : The default behavior for how to adjust commissions when discounting an invoice. This behavior can be overridden on each item if necessary, this provides the default value.

Payouts Default Service Cash Payout Mode: The default behavior for how to distribute cash during Service Cash Payouts. Payout as much cash as possible to employee: The employee will be paid out as much cash as they brought in.

Marketing Options Add new customers to mailing list: If checked, any new customer you create will automatically be added to the mailing list by default. If you use this option, you must respect opt-out requests if you use something other than Constant Contact to manage your mailing list. Default Mobile Provider: If selected, this will automatically be set as a new customer's mobile provider. Only recommended if there are few options for mobile providers in your area. Point Options Enable Points: If checked, customers will earn points as they pay their invoices for goods and services. See Points for more information on how points are earned and redeemed. Default Points Type: The default method for calculating points. The Points Type can be overridden on all services types, inventory items and gift cards. This provides the default that will be used if no override is specified. None : No points are awarded to a customer when paying for an invoice by default. Subtotal : Points are awarded to a customer based on the subtotal. For example, a 200.00 invoice will earn 200.00 points. Subtotal Multiple : Points are awarded to a customer based on the subtotal then multiplied by the Default Points Subtotal Multiple property. For example a subtotal of 200.00 on an invoice with a subtotal multiplier of 2 will earn 400.00 points. Custom : The amount of points awarded is the static value in the Default Points Custom property. For example, a 200.00 invoice with a custom value of 1 will earn 1 point for each service and sold item. Default Points Subtotal Multiplier: The multiplier to apply to the invoice subtotal when the Default Points Type is set to Subtotal Multiple.

For example 5.00% is equal to $0.05 USD. Auto Redeem Points Threshold: The currency value at which a customer's points are exchanged for a reward credit in this amount. Points Required To Redeem: A read only value that shows you how many points a customer will need to earn for their points to exchange to a credit. Point Expiration Days: How many days points are valid before they go stale,meaning points that haven't converted to a credit yet. Set this to zero if your points do not expire. Points Credit Expiration Days: How many days reward credits are valid once the points have been exchanged. Set this to zero if your credits earned from points do not expire.

Per Customer : For each new customer that you create, the referring customer will receive the Referral Credit Amount after they're saved. Per Service : For each new service that you create, the referring customer will receive the Referral Credit Amount. This means that if Jack refers Sally, each time Sally has a service done, Jack will receive the Referral Credit Amount. Referral Credit Amount: The amount that will be created as a new credit for the referring customer for each new referral. Each time a referral happens a credit in this amount will be created for the referring customer. Service Options Enable Walk-in Queue: If checked, the Walk-in Queue feature will be available. If your studio is appointment only, or only do a couple walk-ins per day, you may not need this feature. Default Service Type: The default service type that will be automatically set for all new services. If your studio only performs tattoos it makes sense to set this value to your tattoo service type so you will never have to set it when creating a new service. Default Service Discount Payout Adjustment: The default behavior for how to adjust commissions when discounting a service. This behavior can be overridden on each service if necessary, this provides the default value. Don't adjust payouts : The commission/draw for both the studio and the employee are not adjusted when a discount is applied. You will pay out based on the full amount.

Employee absorbs discount amount in payout : The employee's commission will be reduced to absorb the discount. The location will retain the full draw configured. Automatically set the service end time when it is added to an invoice: If checked, the service end time (the date & time the service was finished) will be set when the service is added to an invoice. If you take payment after a service has been completed it makes sense to use this option since many features rely on a service end time being set. Aftercare Printing Prompt: The behavior that will be used when REV23 Desktop would prompt you to print aftercare forms for all the services on an invoice. Prompt : You will be prompted to print the document when it is ready. You can then decide for each case whether or not to print the document or skip it. Print : The document will automatically be sent to the default printer for this document type when it is ready. Skip : You will not be prompted to print this document and it will not print automatically. If you'd like to print it you will have to print it manually from the Application Button. This setting as well as the 'Sale Receipt Printing Prompt' setting, located in Invoicing & Payment Options, are somewhat dependent on each other. Regardless of the 'Skip' or 'Print' value here, if the Customer Invoice Receipt Printing Prompt is set to 'Prompt', you will still see the dialog asking if you would like to print, giving you the ability to optionally print the aftercare form. In this scenario, if this setting is 'Print', the option to print the aftercare will be checked by default, if it is set to 'Skip', the option to print the aftercare will not be checked by default. Show a warning when trying to complete a service before it has been paid for: If checked, a warning will be displayed when trying to set a service to complete before its invoice has been paid.

Tattoo.pdf Consent Form File Name Date/Time Format: The format to use for the date/time property of the file name if a Consent Form File Name Generation Mode with a [Date Time] option is selected. This property is only visible if the Consent Form File Name Generator Mode contains a date/time place holder. See Date/Time Format Codes for more information. Show Mailing List Opt-In: If checked, the signature pad will display a prompt asking the customer if they'd like to join the mailing list. If customer is already on the mailing list, this prompt is skipped. Enable Signature Capture Auto Close: If checked, once all signatures have been obtained from the signature pad the signature capture window will auto close after 5 seconds. Require Service Provider's Signature on Consent Forms: If checked, the employee of the service will be required to sign the signature pad before the consent form can be generated.

This is an extra layer of protection for your release forms. Auto Export Path: The drive and folder that your consent forms are exported to. This path should not be located on your system drive (i.e. C:) instead it should be on a separate internal hard drive or an external hard drive. If your system drive was to crash you would lose access to your auto exported release forms, which defeats the purpose of this feature. Alternately, you could point this to a cloud storage folder such as OneDrive, Dropbox or Google Drive. Create a subfolder containing the service type: If checked, the auto exported release forms will be placed in a folder that contains the service type's name in the path. For example, if your Auto Export Path is D:\\ConsentForms, they will be placed in subfolders such as D:\\ConsentForms\\Tattoo Create a subfolder containing the service date: If checked, the auto exported release forms will be placed in a folder that contains the service's date in the path. For example, if your Auto Export Path is D:\\ConsentForms, they will be placed in subfolders such as D:\\ConsentForms\\20131031 If you also have the option to create a service type subfolder checked the date folder will be after the service type folder. For example, D:\\ConsentForms\\Tattoo\\20131031 Subfolder Date/Time Format: The format to use for the date/time property of the file name if a subfolder containing the service date is created. Note: This property is only visible if the Create a subfolder containing the service date checkbox is checked. See Date/Time Format Codes for more information.

The first is to allow your artists flexibility to have weekends off if desired. Additionally, they enable you to have more artists than you may possibly have stations in your studio making your shop more versatile and more profitable. Imagine the following scenarios: You have multiple artists that all want weekends off. You have an artist that has an appointment every other Wednesday and isn't in the studio. You have three tattoo stations in your studio but want to hire a fourth artist. These problems and many more are easily solvable with rotating schedules. How do they work? On the surface rotating schedules may seem complicated, but they're actually quite simple. You create a rotating schedule, set a start date, which is any Sunday where the first week of the schedule will land, then define each week's schedule (1-4) and then assign the schedule to a user in their profile.

For example, if you would like to automatically discount a second piercing, three or more piercings, etc... you can accomplish this here. To work, you will need to create at least one Service Type Discount, having at least one tier defined. The tier is where you'll define the quantities and discount to be applied once matched. You can provide multiple tiers where you can create a structure of discounts based on their quantity, such as two piercings = 10% off, three piercings = 15% off, four to five piercings 20% off, six or more piercings 25% off. After you define the discounts, will assign the Bulk Discount Code of each Service Type you wish to apply to this discount. When services are linked to an sale/invoice, the invoice will search for match discount codes and automatically apply the discount for you. Properties Name: The name of the service type discount. The name is required and must be unique. Active: If checked, this discount code will be active. If you want to run limited time promotions, you can easily make the code active during the promotion, and make it inactive once the promotion ends. Customer must match for discount to apply: If checked, the customer on all services added to the invoice must be the same in order for a match to occur.

Each service type has its own set of options such as which consent form to use, and how pricing works. Employee Service Types Each artist that performs services in your studio should be assigned to each service type they perform. This is how REV23 knows who is able to do what, and what their commission should be for each. For example, how an artist gets paid for a tattoo vs. how they get paid for different piercings. See Employee Service Types for more information. Service Type Properties Name: The name of the Service Type. The name is required and must be unique. Family: The body modification family of this service type. - Tattoo - Piercing - Other - Permanent makeup Category: The category of the service type. The category is required. Department: The department of the service type. Healing Time: The typical healing time for this service type. The healing time appears on the default aftercare forms, so while not required, it's a good idea to fill this out. Useful to fill out for adding to aftercare forms . Downsize/Change Out Time: The typical amount of time before the piercing should be downsized. Useful to fill out for adding to aftercare forms . Required Age: The minimum age the customer needs to be to provide their consent for this service type. Consent Form: The consent form template to be used for this service type. Guardian Consent Form: The consent form template to be used for this service when the customer is younger than the required age. If no guardian consent form is specified, it is assumed you are not allowed to perform that service type on minors and REV23 Desktop will prevent you from proceeding with the service. Aftercare Form: The aftercare form template to be used for this service type. Require Placement Area: If checked, you will be required to manually fill in the placement area on the service before you can save the record. This is recommended if your consent form requires the placement area to be provided. Require Amount: If checked, you will be required to have specified an amount for a service before you can save the record. Default Pricing Type: The default pricing type controls how this service type is priced. Custom : The price is determined per service. This is the best option for tattoo service types because the amount is variable. Fixed - Location : The amount is a fixed shop amount, provided in the Amount property. This option is best if you charge a standard amount for each service of this type and is unaffected by who is performing it. Fixed - Employee : The amount is predetermined by the Amount property in the Employee Service Type record. This option is best if you have levels of piercers that charge a different amount for the same type of piercing. Duration : The amount is calculated based on the Employee's hourly rate and the Total Hours that are manually entered in the service. Time (Start/End) : The amount is calculated based on the Employee's hourly rate and the start and end time of the service. Area/Size : The amount is calculated based on the Employee Service Type's area rate and the height/width values on the service. Amount: The amount of this service type. This property is only visible if the Default Pricing Type is set to Fixed - Location . REV23 Recommendation: If you're specifying an amount for a piercing, specify the cost of the piercing only, do not include the price of the jewelry. Instead, you can configure any inventory item to use a special price when it is used as part of a service type. That amount should control inflating the cost. This prevents the need for having to create multiple versions of the same service type just to handle different jewelry (standard vs premium) See the Service Type Inventory Items topic for more information. Discount Code: The service type bulk discount code to match when a service of this type is added to an invoice. Tax: If required, specify the tax to be used for this service type and calculated into its total price. Draw Type: The portion of the commission the studio will take when this service is performed in the Location Payout. Think hard about how your commissions work before choosing this value, as you will configure the artist/piercer commission on their Employee Service Type record, so you'll obviously want everything to match up in the end. For example, setting this value to a percentage of 50%, then having an artist configured at 60% would equal 110%, which obviously wouldn't work, but REV23 Desktop will not stop you in this scenario. None : No Location Payout will be calculated. Any remainder left over after the employee's commission has been calculated will be placed in the Remaining Payout. Fixed : The Location Payout will be a fixed amount, provided in the Draw Amount property. This option is less common. Any remainder left over after the employee's commission has been calculated will be placed in the Remaining Payout. Percent : The Location Payout will be a percentage of the service amount, provided in the Draw Percentage property. Any remainder left over after the employee's commission has been calculated will be placed in the Remaining Payout. Remainder : The Location Payout will be whatever amount is remaining after the artist/piercer's commission has been calculated. This is the most common option for draw type, as it easily allows for variable commission rates for each artist/piercer. Draw Percentage: The percentage of the location payout. This property is only visible if the Draw Type is set to Percent. Draw Amount: The amount of the location payout. This property is only visible if the Draw Type is set to Fixed. Dynamic Commission: If applicable, the dynamic commission to be used for this service type. To use dynamic commissions for this service type, this value is required and the Commission Type on the Employee Service Type must be set to dynamic for the artists/piercers you'd like to participate in dynamic commissions. Override Points: If checked, you can specify a different point structure than provided in your studio's default points. This is useful if you want to structure service points separately from retail points, or want to run limited promotions. For example, you may have a weekend where all ear piercings earn double points. You could then override points on your service types for lobe, tragus, helix, etc..., then remove the override after the promotion has ended. Points Type: The method for calculating points. None : No points are awarded to a customer. Subtotal : Points are awarded to a customer based on the subtotal. For example, a 200.00 invoice will earn 200.00 points. Subtotal Multiple : Points are awarded to a customer based on the subtotal then multiplied by the Points Subtotal Multiple property. For example a subtotal of 200.00 on an invoice with a subtotal multiplier of 2 will earn 400.00 points. Custom : The amount of points awarded is the static value in the Points Custom property. For example, a 200.00 service with a custom value of 1 will earn 1 point. Points Subtotal Multiplier: The multiplier to apply to the invoice subtotal when the Default Points Type is set to Subtotal Multiple. Note: This property is only visible if the Points Type is set to Subtotal Multiple. Points Custom: The static point value for each item and service on an invoice when the Default Card Points Type is set to Custom. Note: This property is only visible if the Points Type is set to Custom. Description: The description of this service. If you wanted to provide technical information about the procedure to the customer on the aftercare form for example, you could enter that information here. Follow-up Options Follow Up Days: When a follow up task is created, the task will be set for this many days from the service date. For example, if you'd like to follow up two weeks later, set this value to 14. Create Follow Up Task: If checked, a task will be created when the service is finished and will be assigned to the artist/piercer for them to follow up with the client. Send Text/Email Follow-up: If checked, the Virtual Receptionist will run its default follow-up flow for text and email reminders for this service type. Uncheck this for service types that do not require follow-ups. See Service Follow-Ups for more information. Piercing Options These properties are only visible if the Family property is set to Piercing . Default Gauge: If applicable, you can specify the default gauge this piercing is generally done with. When the service is created for this type, it will use this gauge, you can then override it per service as needed. Default Length/Diameter: If applicable, you can specify the default length/diameter this piercing is generally done with. When the service is created for this type, it will use this length/diameter, you can then override it per service as needed. Default Anchor Rise: If applicable, you can specify the default anchor rise this piercing is generally done with.

For example, setting this value to a percentage of 50%, then having an artist configured at 60% would equal 110%, which obviously wouldn't work, but REV23 Desktop will not stop you in this scenario. None : No Location Payout will be calculated. Any remainder left over after the employee's commission has been calculated will be placed in the Remaining Payout. Fixed : The Location Payout will be a fixed amount, provided in the Draw Amount property. This option is less common. Any remainder left over after the employee's commission has been calculated will be placed in the Remaining Payout. Percent : The Location Payout will be a percentage of the service amount, provided in the Draw Percentage property. Any remainder left over after the employee's commission has been calculated will be placed in the Remaining Payout. Remainder : The Location Payout will be whatever amount is remaining after the artist/piercer's commission has been calculated. This is the most common option for draw type, as it easily allows for variable commission rates for each artist/piercer. Draw Percentage: The percentage of the location payout. This property is only visible if the Draw Type is set to Percent. Draw Amount: The amount of the location payout. This property is only visible if the Draw Type is set to Fixed. Dynamic Commission: If applicable, the dynamic commission to be used for this service type. To use dynamic commissions for this service type, this value is required and the Commission Type on the Employee Service Type must be set to dynamic for the artists/piercers you'd like to participate in dynamic commissions. Override Points: If checked, you can specify a different point structure than provided in your studio's default points. This is useful if you want to structure service points separately from retail points, or want to run limited promotions. For example, you may have a weekend where all ear piercings earn double points. You could then override points on your service types for lobe, tragus, helix, etc..., then remove the override after the promotion has ended. Points Type: The method for calculating points. None : No points are awarded to a customer. Subtotal : Points are awarded to a customer based on the subtotal. For example, a 200.00 invoice will earn 200.00 points. Subtotal Multiple : Points are awarded to a customer based on the subtotal then multiplied by the Points Subtotal Multiple property. For example a subtotal of 200.00 on an invoice with a subtotal multiplier of 2 will earn 400.00 points. Custom : The amount of points awarded is the static value in the Points Custom property. For example, a 200.00 service with a custom value of 1 will earn 1 point. Points Subtotal Multiplier: The multiplier to apply to the invoice subtotal when the Default Points Type is set to Subtotal Multiple. Note: This property is only visible if the Points Type is set to Subtotal Multiple. Points Custom: The static point value for each item and service on an invoice when the Default Card Points Type is set to Custom. Note: This property is only visible if the Points Type is set to Custom. Description: The description of this service. If you wanted to provide technical information about the procedure to the customer on the aftercare form for example, you could enter that information here.","title":"Service Type Properties"},{"location":"configuration/service-types/#follow-up-options","text":"Follow Up Days: When a follow up task is created, the task will be set for this many days from the service date.

We fully support multiple studios in a number of ways, allowing you to decide what's best for you. You will need to make a decision about how you want to use REV23 Desktop with your multiple studios, either isolated or connected. We can provide guidelines, but ultimately the decision is yours to make. What is an Isolated Studio? An isolated studio is a REV23 Desktop server setup at each physical location. You may have only one studio (in which case you don't really need to read any further in this topic), or you may have eight of them, but when isolated, no studio has any knowledge of the other. They are completely separate. Each studio has its own database, SQL Server, REV23 Desktop Control Panel, and Services. Even though isolated, REV23 Desktop can optionally be configured to allow you to connect to multiple databases. In this scenario you will be prompted for which database to connect to before seeing the log on screen. You will then see the normal logon screen for that studio. This feature is optional. For example, the studios themselves would never have to be prompted for the connection they would just default to their own database, and this prompt would likely be exclusive to the owner's PC. With multiple isolated studios, you can have REV23 Desktop prompt you for which database you'd like to connect to. In this scenario, both studios in California and New York are isolated and you can choose which one you'd like to connect to before you see the log on screen. What is a Connected Studio? Connected studios are when a REV23 Desktop server is setup at one studio, and your other studios connect to it with Add-on PCs via Remote Connections. The big benefits to connected studios is the ability to share customers, employees, vendors, inventory items, templates, notes etc... as well as optionally making deposits and gift cards redeemable at any of your businesses. Even when connected, you can treat the studios as isolated if you'd prefer, meaning you don't have to mingle things, but the options are there for you should you chose to do so. There are some possible negative side effects when using connected studios, however. Because the database is physically in a different location, the connected studios that exist outside of the walls of the database are often a bit slower to perform tasks. There is a lot of data going back and forth, so the internet has to be fast and it has to be stable. When connected, there is only one database serving all locations from one physical location, one REV23 Desktop Control Panel and the Virtual Receptionist, Integration Service and Backup Service all handle each studio. In this scenario, two studios are connected. When working with connected studios you will choose the location in the same database you want to log on to on the log on screen. Deciding between Isolated or Connected studios Now, you have to decide how you want to setup each one. Once you chose a path it's not particularly easy to shift should you decide to change it later. Use these guidelines to help you determine what might be a better fit for you. These are only guidelines, you're free to choose whichever implementation you'd like. Connected Studios Are your studios geographically close together where a customer may go to one or the other? Do you have artists that travel between your studios? Would you like to check inventory at another one of your studios without calling them? Do all studios have high speed internet that is reliable and always on? If some of all of these are true, Connected Studios might be for you. Isolated Studios Are your studios geographically far apart? Would it be improbable that an artist would travel between your studios? Is your internet at one or more studios slow or unreliable? Are your studios completely separate businesses? Are you the managing owner of one studio, while a partner mostly owns another studio? If some or all of these are true, Isolated Studios are probably the way to go. Mix and Match You may have studios that meet a little bit of each criteria. For example, you might have a few studio's geographically close where the artists do travel between them, and then have one on the other side of the country. Consider that you could use connected studios on one set, then isolate the others. The choice is completely up to you.","title":"Connected Studios"},{"location":"connection-concepts/connected-studios/#connected-studios","text":"If you have multiple businesses that you want to track using REV23 Desktop, that's great! We fully support multiple studios in a number of ways, allowing you to decide what's best for you. You will need to make a decision about how you want to use REV23 Desktop with your multiple studios, either isolated or connected. We can provide guidelines, but ultimately the decision is yours to make.","title":"Connected Studios"},{"location":"connection-concepts/connected-studios/#what-is-an-isolated-studio","text":"An isolated studio is a REV23 Desktop server setup at each physical location. You may have only one studio (in which case you don't really need to read any further in this topic), or you may have eight of them, but when isolated, no studio has any knowledge of the other. They are completely separate. Each studio has its own database, SQL Server, REV23 Desktop Control Panel, and Services. Even though isolated, REV23 Desktop can optionally be configured to allow you to connect to multiple databases. In this scenario you will be prompted for which database to connect to before seeing the log on screen. You will then see the normal logon screen for that studio. This feature is optional. For example, the studios themselves would never have to be prompted for the connection they would just default to their own database, and this prompt would likely be exclusive to the owner's PC. With multiple isolated studios, you can have REV23 Desktop prompt you for which database you'd like to connect to. In this scenario, both studios in California and New York are isolated and you can choose which one you'd like to connect to before you see the log on screen.","title":"What is an Isolated Studio?"},{"location":"connection-concepts/connected-studios/#what-is-a-connected-studio","text":"Connected studios are when a REV23 Desktop server is setup at one studio, and your other studios connect to it with Add-on PCs via Remote Connections. The big benefits to connected studios is the ability to share customers, employees, vendors, inventory items, templates, notes etc... as well as optionally making deposits and gift cards redeemable at any of your businesses. Even when connected, you can treat the studios as isolated if you'd prefer, meaning you don't have to mingle things, but the options are there for you should you chose to do so. There are some possible negative side effects when using connected studios, however. Because the database is physically in a different location, the connected studios that exist outside of the walls of the database are often a bit slower to perform tasks. There is a lot of data going back and forth, so the internet has to be fast and it has to be stable. When connected, there is only one database serving all locations from one physical location, one REV23 Desktop Control Panel and the Virtual Receptionist, Integration Service and Backup Service all handle each studio. In this scenario, two studios are connected. When working with connected studios you will choose the location in the same database you want to log on to on the log on screen.","title":"What is a Connected Studio?"},{"location":"connection-concepts/connected-studios/#deciding-between-isolated-or-connected-studios","text":"Now, you have to decide how you want to setup each one.

Your PC crashed. This can either be a pretty smooth process, or a very painful and unfortunate lesson in data backup policies. You do have a database backup? Right? We constantly stress the importance of database backups to our users. There is no cloud backup of your REV23 Desktop database. All data is stored on your main PC, hence the name 'main'. If you have followed our advice, you have an external hard drive plugged into your main PC where the Backup Service takes a backup on a regular interval. In this case, life is easy. Install the REV23 Desktop main PC on your new or cleaned PC and restore the database backup. What's that? You don't have a database backup? Well, things get a little hairy here and you're potentially dealing with full data loss depending on the nature of the computer crash. It is advised you take your PC to a repair place and ensure they read these instructions carefully to attempt to recover your data. Get Hard Drive Access If you're able to boot into Windows, even in safe-mode, this would be great. From safe-mode, you should be able to take a backup of your database using the REV23 Desktop Control Panel. In a situation where the PC is not booting at all you will need to access the hard drive contents from a PC that is working. If the hard drive is corrupted and not spinning up at all, and you have no external backup then unfortunately, there is nothing you can do to recover your data other than attempt to pay for an expensive data recovery process that may or may not even work. Local Backup Location If you were not backing your data up to an external hard drive there is still a good chance there are some database backups on your local hard drive where REV23 Desktop is installed. This is of course a dangerous backup strategy because if your hard drive is corrupted, your data and backups could also be corrupted. This is why the use of an external hard drive is so important. However, there are instances where your data is backed up there automatically and you can attempt to recover these backups. We automatically take a backup to this path when: The Backup Service has not been configured. Every time you update to a new version of REV23 Desktop. When the software is closed and a backup has not been taken for 7 days. If you're able to access the contents of the hard drive look to the default backup location.

Recover as many of these as you can just in case, but you'll obviously want to attempt to restore the most recent backup copy. If you previously used Tattoo Management Studio and upgraded to REV23 Desktop, you may also check the Program Files directory for the Tattoo Management Studio sub-folder which may also contain backups, though likely much older. Data File Location You may also attempt to access the SQL Server data files. These contain your database as it existed before the crash occurs, however re-attaching these files is not always guaranteed to work and a backup is generally the safest bet. You can attempt to locate these files in the Microsoft SQL Server installation directory.

The REV23 Desktop Inventory system is unmatched by competitors for how specific it is to our industry. Along with real time inventory tracking, automated bulk discounts and more, REV23 Desktop includes powerful options to associate items to specific service types, allowing full control on how to automate inventory when dealing with particular procedures. For example, discounting a piece of jewelry because it was done with a particular piercing type, including free aftercare that is automatically added (and discounted) on the sale during particular service types, or even reducing your disposables (gloves, needles, tubes, etc...), after completing a service. Properties Name: The name of the inventory item. The name is required, and should be descriptive as this will be the main identifier of the item in REV23 Desktop and printed on sale receipts. Category: The inventory category of this item. The category is required. Categories are used mostly for organization of your items for quick access. Department: The inventory department of this item. The department is optional but recommended. Departments are useful for reporting at a high level (i.e. how much aftercare have you sold, regardless of brand or type). Inventory Item Type: The particular type of item (if applicable). - General: A general use item that is not specific to tattooing or piercing such as gloves or a t-shirt. - Tattoo: An item specific for tattooing. - Piercing: An item specific for piercing which will have more properties in the Piercing Item Specifications property.

This is particularly useful for jewelry. Quantity Per Unit: The usable or sellable quantity in this item. If you buy this as a single item, the quantity per unit is one (1). If however, you purchase this in a case of twenty four (24), the usable quantity will be twenty four (24). Likewise a single box of gloves would likely have a quantity per unit of one hundred (100). This is an important factor in determining cost per unit pricing, as well as reordering. For example, if its a case, when you receive two cases, it will at 48 to your quantity on hand. So this is an important value not to get wrong, so think about how you use and sell the item before setting this value. Color: The primary color of this inventory item.

For example, a 200.00 invoice will earn 200.00 points. Subtotal Multiple : Points are awarded to a customer based on the subtotal then multiplied by the Points Subtotal Multiple property. For example a subtotal of 200.00 on an invoice with a subtotal multiplier of 2 will earn 400.00 points. Custom : The amount of points awarded is the static value in the Points Custom property. For example, a 200.00 service with a custom value of 1 will earn 1 point.

On Hand: How many of this item you currently have in inventory. Units On Order: How many units of this item you currently have on order. Use Automatic Ordering: If checked, when the on hand value is less than or equal to the reorder point, the Units On Order will automatically update itself to be the Reorder Units value.

We realize this is a whole lot of information, but we offer it for those studios who want very in-depth reporting of their inventory. This level of inventory customization allows you to questions such as \"does anodized jewelry sell better than non anodized?\" So it all depends on what you as a shop owner are interested in.

Welcome to Gotham City Tattoo & Piercing, a new studio opened in Gotham City, NJ, best known as the home of the masked vigilante, Batman . Harley Quinn, former accomplice of The Joker, has given up her villainous ways. She's decided to put her tattooing talent to use, and has started a new body modification business. But one thing has always bothered at her... just who was Batman? With her new business, she's got an idea that she thinks will allow her to discover his secret identity. By tattooing and piercing the citizens of Gotham, she will be able to look for any distinctive scars or other clues that would show signs that the client is possibly the mysterious Batman. In the meantime though, she wants to put out some killer artwork and have some fun. Harley has enlisted her friends to help out at the shop. She has hired Pam Isley, also known as Poison Ivy, who happens to be a gifted tattoo artist (mostly floral designs); and Selina Kyle, also known as Catwoman, as a body piercer, and manager of the shop. Each will be paid 50% commission on their services. As the manager, Selina will also receive hourly pay of $10.00/hour. They've made the decision to use REV23 Desktop, and they're ready to get started!

Adding a piercer can be done using these same steps, however, in the Assign service types section, when we added the tattoo service type, we added just the single Tattoo service type. The piercing family, having many more types of services would be time consuming. So, you can do that, but, Harley is a busy lady and has better things to do. Here we will add Selina as a piercer as well as a manager of the studio. Using the Add Service Types Action In the Employee List View, as well as the Employee Detail View, there is an action in the ribbon for adding multiple service types to one or more artists all in just a few clicks. Create a new Employee record for the piercer and fill out the necessary information.

Consent and Aftercare forms, as well as other various bits of text, such as the text message and email appointment reminders, exist as Templates. REV23 Desktop comes with default templates for every scenario, including tattoo & body piercing consent and aftercare forms. However, you probably have your own you'd like to use, or maybe you'd just like to make minor modifications to the templates provided. Here's the catch. Each time the software is updated, we overwrite our built-in templates. Meaning, if you modify one of the built-in templates, the next time you update REV23 Desktop to a new version, your change will be erased and replaced with the default one again. So you can either start a new template using the New action, or, most commonly, you can modify an existing template by first copying it using the Clone action. This is the approach we will take in this topic. Navigate to Configuration > Templates to open the Template List View. You'll need to be logged on as an Administrator or Manager user to access this area. Select the Consent Form for Tattoo (REV23) record, and click the Clone action. This will open the Template Detail View for our newly created copy. Provide a new name in the Name editor. Click the Show Template Designer action on the ribbon to open the Template Designer. The Template designer is a full word processor that allows you to format your templates however you'd like, as well as insert fields that are populated from the database. The Template Designer itself is a complex topic, so here we will only cover the basics and make a couple of changes. Hint: Looking at the Template Designer, we can see some data already exists from a service we created earlier. These are previews of the Service records we created earlier. It will randomly show you a record so that you can see what the template looks like with actual data. You can change the record you're looking at by using the Mail Merge tab on the ribbon and changing the Current Record editor to scroll through up to 50 records. This is useful so you can see what longer names or larger IDs do to the formatting of the template and make sure to adjust for them. Don't worry, this data is not saved to the template and is only there for preview purposes. We see a couple of changes we'd like to make. First, the logo we selected in the Setup Wizard is too large. The logo can be changed either by selecting a new image in Options (which is probably a better idea, since it will adjust all templates), but you can also resize it here. We will click it to see its bounding box, then click and drag an anchor to resize it. That looks better already! Now we'd like to update the release form to use the Mobile Phone Number. Erase the entire line that says \"Home Phone: < >.\" You can replace with with \"Mobile Phone: \" and leave the cursor blinking in that spot. On the right hand side of the Template Designer is the Data Explorer. This allows us to insert a field which will read data from the database. In this case, a release form is based on the Service data type, so we can access all properties of a Service here. Scroll to the top of the data explorer window. Notice the arrows next to each Property. This allows you to drill down into each property to see the properties of that property. For example, the Customer is a property of Service, and Mobile Phone Number is a property of Customer. So, we'll need to expand the Customer property to see what we have access to. So, our path will be Service -> Customer -> Mobile Phone Number. Locate the Mobile Phone Number property nested inside the Customer Property. Click and drag it to the spot you'd like to insert it into the template, then release the mouse button. You can also double click it to insert it to wherever the cursor is blinking in the document. We're now properly displaying the mobile phone number. Our template looks pretty good, and we can come back to it later at any time to add additional details or formatting. But now, we need to tell REV23 Desktop to use this template instead of the default. Save the Template using the Save action in the top left corner of the Template Designer to close it, then click the Save & Close action in the Template Detail View. Navigate to Configuration -> Service Types. Locate the Tattoo service type in the Service Type List View and double click it to open the Service Type Detail View. This detail view should look familiar as we saw it earlier when we were settting service prices. Change the Consent Form editor to the new template we just created. Then Save & Close the Service Type Detail View. That's it! We've now created a new template for our Tattoo Consent Form and have told REV23 Desktop to use it instead of the default. Now, whenever a consent form is generated for this service type, it will use this new one. You can repeat this process for any additional service types that will use this same template. Templates are versatile and easily reused. For example, you don't need a different template for each piercing type. Using the values from each service type, you're able to insert fields for the name, healing time, etc.. so don't create more templates than you really need. Now that you have your own copy, any time you edit it, the service type will automatically pick up these changes, and you do not need to repeat the step of setting it in this step. There is now some commotion up front, and Commissioner Gordon has returned to the shop. He looks pretty mad and is demanding a refund. Let's check out what's happening.","title":"Alter release & aftercare forms"},{"location":"quick-start/modify-consent-form/#quick-start-modify-consent-form","text":"We noticed a few things on the release forms earlier that we'd like to change, so now seems like a good time to get that taken care of.

In this case, a release form is based on the Service data type, so we can access all properties of a Service here. Scroll to the top of the data explorer window. Notice the arrows next to each Property. This allows you to drill down into each property to see the properties of that property. For example, the Customer is a property of Service, and Mobile Phone Number is a property of Customer. So, we'll need to expand the Customer property to see what we have access to. So, our path will be Service -> Customer -> Mobile Phone Number. Locate the Mobile Phone Number property nested inside the Customer Property. Click and drag it to the spot you'd like to insert it into the template, then release the mouse button. You can also double click it to insert it to wherever the cursor is blinking in the document. We're now properly displaying the mobile phone number. Our template looks pretty good, and we can come back to it later at any time to add additional details or formatting. But now, we need to tell REV23 Desktop to use this template instead of the default. Save the Template using the Save action in the top left corner of the Template Designer to close it, then click the Save & Close action in the Template Detail View. Navigate to Configuration -> Service Types. Locate the Tattoo service type in the Service Type List View and double click it to open the Service Type Detail View. This detail view should look familiar as we saw it earlier when we were settting service prices. Change the Consent Form editor to the new template we just created. Then Save & Close the Service Type Detail View. That's it! We've now created a new template for our Tattoo Consent Form and have told REV23 Desktop to use it instead of the default. Now, whenever a consent form is generated for this service type, it will use this new one. You can repeat this process for any additional service types that will use this same template. Templates are versatile and easily reused. For example, you don't need a different template for each piercing type. Using the values from each service type, you're able to insert fields for the name, healing time, etc.. so don't create more templates than you really need. Now that you have your own copy, any time you edit it, the service type will automatically pick up these changes, and you do not need to repeat the step of setting it in this step. There is now some commotion up front, and Commissioner Gordon has returned to the shop. He looks pretty mad and is demanding a refund. Let's check out what's happening.","title":"Quick Start: Modify consent form"},{"location":"quick-start/refund-an-item/","text":"Quick Start: Refund an item Refunding an item Commissioner Gordon has returned just an hour after he left from getting his new tattoo, and he is furious.

Business must go on. Luckily, we have a body piercer hanging around to start taking some walk-in piercings. Let's see how a walk-in works. From the Today Dashboard click the New Walk-In action -OR- Navigate to Home -> Services to open the Service List View, then click the New action to open the Service Detail View. Hint: The step of navigating to the list view isn't actually necessary. From most any screen you're in you can click the down arrow on the New action and select Service from the drop down menu. So, if you're in the Appointment Scheduler already and get a walk-in, there is no need to leave it. In the Service Detail View, we'll set up the service. For services, we only need a few things to get it rolling. The extent you need to fill this out is up to your health department. Customer: Required. Obviously. Service Type: Required. The type of service you're performing. Employee: Required. The employee providing the service. Placement Area: Recommended. The placement of the service on the body. If a piercing (what we're doing in this case) the name of the piercing itself generally guides this and is unnecessary. Design Description: Mostly for tattoos, or large piercing projects. A description of what is being done. Amount: The amount you're charging for the service. Generally you'll only fill this editor out when dealing with tattoos, since in most cases, piercing prices are fixed and determined by the studio. Like we saw when we scheduled an appointment for a customer, we can click the Customer editor to search for a customer by name, or create a new customer by clicking the New action or Scan/Swipe ID action. Since this client has her ID with her, we'll click the Scan/Swipe ID action to open the Customer Detail View and pre-fill that data in. Hint: If you do not yet have a barcode reader or magstripe stripe swiper, when REV23 Desktop is waiting for you to to scan the ID, press the letter 'D' on your keyboard to use demo data, which demonstrates the information that can be extracted from the ID. By swiping the ID, we will obtain the following fields automatically without any typing: First name, middle name, last name, gender, birthday, address, driver's license number and state. We'll add a few more fields such as email and mobile phone + provider. The next time this client returns, swiping the ID will recall this record, including any changes we've made. Hover over the ID Image Editor. We can click the scan button in the Image Editor to acquire the ID Image from the document scanner. After we have scanned the ID image, click the Save & Close action to return to the Service Detail View. This customer is now set in the Customer editor. Now that the customer is entered in, we will select Lobe as the Service Type, and select Selina as the Employee. Notice that employees that are not assigned to the selected Service Type do not show up in the employee list, so when we clicked the Employee editor, only Selina appeared. Because we've previously set the Lobe piercing price to $20.00 in the Setting service prices quick start topic, the Amount has been defaulted for us to $20.00 and can not be modified. Here, we could also set some jewelry parameters in the Gauge, Length/Diameter editors, but we will keep this as light as possible for now. The only additional change we will make is to set the Quantity to 2, since our client wants both of her ear lobes pierced. It's time for the release form!

Unlike other actions we've dealt with so far, this does not appear on the ribbon. Instead, you can find it in the Detail View itself underneath the main group of editors we just filled out. This will prompt the client to sign the signature pad device, generate the release form, and store it in the database. Optionally, you can have the signed document emailed to the client. If you do not have the Signature Pad, click the Print Consent Form action. This will fill the client's details and ID image onto a release form that is printed and ready to be signed. Hint: Hold the SHIFT key down on your keyboard while clicking this action to preview the consent form instead. The release form looks pretty good. There are a few things that stand out that we would like to fix (our logo is too large), so we will come back to this later. For now, we have a release form that the client can sign.

Business must go on. Luckily, we have a body piercer hanging around to start taking some walk-in piercings. Let's see how a walk-in works. From the Today Dashboard click the New Walk-In action -OR- Navigate to Home -> Services to open the Service List View, then click the New action to open the Service Detail View. Hint: The step of navigating to the list view isn't actually necessary. From most any screen you're in you can click the down arrow on the New action and select Service from the drop down menu. So, if you're in the Appointment Scheduler already and get a walk-in, there is no need to leave it. In the Service Detail View, we'll set up the service. For services, we only need a few things to get it rolling. The extent you need to fill this out is up to your health department. Customer: Required. Obviously. Service Type: Required. The type of service you're performing. Employee: Required. The employee providing the service. Placement Area: Recommended. The placement of the service on the body. If a piercing (what we're doing in this case) the name of the piercing itself generally guides this and is unnecessary. Design Description: Mostly for tattoos, or large piercing projects. A description of what is being done. Amount: The amount you're charging for the service. Generally you'll only fill this editor out when dealing with tattoos, since in most cases, piercing prices are fixed and determined by the studio. Like we saw when we scheduled an appointment for a customer, we can click the Customer editor to search for a customer by name, or create a new customer by clicking the New action or Scan/Swipe ID action. Since this client has her ID with her, we'll click the Scan/Swipe ID action to open the Customer Detail View and pre-fill that data in. Hint: If you do not yet have a barcode reader or magstripe stripe swiper, when REV23 Desktop is waiting for you to to scan the ID, press the letter 'D' on your keyboard to use demo data, which demonstrates the information that can be extracted from the ID. By swiping the ID, we will obtain the following fields automatically without any typing: First name, middle name, last name, gender, birthday, address, driver's license number and state. We'll add a few more fields such as email and mobile phone + provider. The next time this client returns, swiping the ID will recall this record, including any changes we've made. Hover over the ID Image Editor. We can click the scan button in the Image Editor to acquire the ID Image from the document scanner. After we have scanned the ID image, click the Save & Close action to return to the Service Detail View. This customer is now set in the Customer editor. Now that the customer is entered in, we will select Lobe as the Service Type, and select Selina as the Employee. Notice that employees that are not assigned to the selected Service Type do not show up in the employee list, so when we clicked the Employee editor, only Selina appeared. Because we've previously set the Lobe piercing price to $20.00 in the Setting service prices quick start topic, the Amount has been defaulted for us to $20.00 and can not be modified. Here, we could also set some jewelry parameters in the Gauge, Length/Diameter editors, but we will keep this as light as possible for now. The only additional change we will make is to set the Quantity to 2, since our client wants both of her ear lobes pierced. It's time for the release form!

We previously set Pam to have 50% commission on tattoos she performs when we added her as a service provider. We will modify her commission settings to use our new dynamic commission. Using this new commission type, her commission will adjust each week based on her revenue. Her new pay structure will be as follows: 50% for $0 - $1,999 55% for $2,000 - $2,499 60% for $2,500 or more. You will need to be logged on as the Administrator or a Manager to proceed with this topic. Note: Dynamic Commissions use the First Day Of Week setting in Studio Options.

For example, some studios may have a Class A, Class B, and Class C commission structure, where the demands of Class C are much harder to meet than the Class A tiers.

License Expiration Date: The expiration date of this employee's license. When specified, you will be warned when creating a service of this type once the expiration is sixty (60) days away from the current date, then, every ten (10) days afterwords until there is only ten (10) days remaining, at which point you will be warned every day. Amount: The fixed amount to charge for this service when being performed by this artist. This value is only used if the Service Type's Pricing Source is set to 'Fixed - Employee'. This is useful if you have levels of piercers that charge a different amount for the same type of piercing (i.e. master piercer, apprentice, etc...). Area Rate: For tattoos, the rate to charge per square inch, foot, etc... (whichever measurement unit you've decided on). This value is only used when the service's pricing source is set to 'Area'. Hourly Rate: For tattoos, the rate to charge per hour. This is calculated by the service's start and end time. Hourly Rate Minimum: When using an hourly rate, the minimum amount to charge in the event the rate with the service's total time is less than the artist's minimum. Rounding Direction: When the commission is calculated using an hourly rate and the start and end time of the service, you can round the time up or down to the nearest quarter, half or full hour. None : The total hours will not be rounded, it will be an exact value of time. Up : The total hours will be rounded up to the nearest interval, specified below. Down : The total hours will be rounded down to the nearest interval, specified below. Rounding Interval: When the rounding direction is set to a value of Up or Down, you need to specify the interval in which the time will round to. Quarter : Round to the nearest 15 minute interval. Half : Round to the nearest 30 minute interval. Full : Round to the nearest 60 minute interval.

An employee must be assigned one or more roles in order to log on to REV23 Desktop. Each role contains settings such as the ability to print and export, as well as a list of type permissions (appointments, services, customers all being different types). Along with each type you're able to specify what users in that role are able to do: Read (see data), Write (save data), Create (create new records), Delete (delete records) and/or Navigate (visible in the navbar). Roles also evaluate permissions from the bottom up, meaning the lowest level permission always wins. As an example, you assign a user to the manager role, then assign them to a lower role such as cashier, some things may be disallowed. For this reason, if you want to assign a user to the manager role that should be the only role they're assigned to. Several roles for the most common scenarios are built-in and should mostly suit your needs. If you need to modify roles at any time you should not modify the built-in roles as they are overwritten with each REV23 Desktop update and your changes would be lost. Instead you can either clone an existing role to make minor tweaks, or create a new role entirely, which will remain untouched during system updates. Roles can get quite complex, and this topic will only cover the very basics. If you're interested in modifying roles you should first contact REV23 Support, to explain what you would like to do so we can assist you. The roles that are built-in are required by the system and cannot be deleted or renamed. Role Additives Some roles are known as Additive roles. These can be distinguished by the plus symbol (+) in front of their name. For example, the + Discounts, and + Payouts roles. Additive roles are not full roles themselves, and only add functionality to existing roles. For example, be default, only the Manager role can add discounts to services and retail items. By adding the + Discounts role to a user in the cashier role, that user will now be able to discount services and items. A warning about creating custom roles There are some drawbacks to creating/cloning your own roles. If a type permission does not exist in a role, it will deny access completely. So, take the built-in Inventory Manager role for example. It contains all of the types used for inventory configuration and management. Lets say you like the Inventory Manager as it is, but want to make one minor change... you want to prevent those users from deleting inventory items. You could clone the role, remove the delete permission from the Inventory Item type and then assign the new role to your users and everything will work great. However, if in a new version of REV23 Desktop we introduce a new inventory configuration object, our built-in Inventory Manager role would include that new type, but your cloned version would not. Because of this you would not immediately see the new object type (or perhaps not even know that it exists at all), until you manually add the type to your custom role. For this reason we recommend sticking to the default roles or creating additive roles. If you have suggestions on how we can improve the default roles, please let us know. Connected Studio Behavior Roles are global and do not differ between your connected studios. However, users can exist in different roles in each of your studios. So you could have a piercer that travels between two of your studios in the service provider role, but also exist in the manager role in their primary studio.","title":"Roles"},{"location":"security-concepts/roles/#roles","text":"Roles are sets of individual permissions that control what your users are able to see and do in REV23 Desktop.

However, if in a new version of REV23 Desktop we introduce a new inventory configuration object, our built-in Inventory Manager role would include that new type, but your cloned version would not. Because of this you would not immediately see the new object type (or perhaps not even know that it exists at all), until you manually add the type to your custom role. For this reason we recommend sticking to the default roles or creating additive roles. If you have suggestions on how we can improve the default roles, please let us know.","title":"A warning about creating custom roles"},{"location":"security-concepts/roles/#connected-studio-behavior","text":"Roles are global and do not differ between your connected studios.

Solution 1 The most common cause of this problem is that the user is not properly configured to receive a commission for the missing service type(s). Services where the commission would be zero do not appear on payout reports. As the Administrator user, open the Service Detail View of the Service that is missing, and inspect the payout information. Is there a commission set? If not, this user does not have a properly configured Employee Service Type record for the selected service type. Note that after you modify the commission for that Employee Service Type, it does not retroactively apply to existing services. If you wish to include the missing services after correcting the user's commission, you can return to each service individually for that user and either modify the Employee or Service Type property, then revert it back to the correct value. This will refresh the configuration for that service, including payout data. Solution 2 If you've verified that the user is being paid a commission on that service but it's still not showing up on payout reports, it is likely being filtered by the Use Business Hours for Reporting option in Locations and My Studio.

Some are used for navigation and others are object specific. If an action appears dimmed then that action is disabled for the selected object(s). Records Creation Clone: In some views, a Clone action will appear. Think of the clone action like a copy & paste with with objects. Creating a clone will take the selected object's values and create a new object with those existing values in place. This is particularly useful for inventory items where you want to create a variant of a single item. Edit Delete: The Delete action will delete either the currently selected row(s) in a list view, or the current object in a detail view. You can find the Delete action in the Home tab of the ribbon in the Edit group. Deleting some objects, such as an Invoice, will present a different user interface than the standard prompt. When an object is deleted, in most cases it technically stays in the database but is invisible to the user interface. This way you do not lose record of those objects if they were set as a property on another object. Use caution when deleting objects. While they technically remain in the database, once deleted they cannot be recovered by either yourself or Support. View Refresh: The Refresh action will refresh the data in the list view or a single object in a detail view. You can find the Refresh action in the Home tab of the ribbon in the View group. When you refresh in a list view the list will be refresh from the database. For example, if you have add-on PCs connecting to the REV23 Desktop database and one PC has the Customer List View opened and on another PC a new customer is added, you can execute the Refresh action on the first PC and that customer will now appear in the Customer List View. When you refresh in a detail view that single object will have the data that is in the database loaded. For example, if you have multiple PCs connecting to the REV23 Desktop database and one PC makes a change to a customer you also have opened, you can execute the Refresh action on the first PC and that customer's new data will be loaded, however, changes you have made will be discarded. If you have add-on PCs you don't always need to refresh manually. Switching between list views is enough to refresh the data. Only when that view is already opened and you want to load new data do you need to manually execute the Refresh action. Similarly when you open a detail view it will read the new data from the database. Only when that detail view is already opened do you need to manually refresh. Reset View Settings: The Reset View Settings action will reset any view customizations for the currently logged in user, such as column sorting, visibility, detail view editors, etc... back to defaults. This only applies to the current view. Show Change History: The Show Change History action will show the selected object's audit trail, or change history. The change history is a useful tool to show what changes have been made to an object such as the date/time it was created, modified, what the previous value was, what the new value was set to, as well as who made the change. This creates accountability in your shop by your users. You can find the Show Change History action in the Home tab of the ribbon in the View group. Open Related Record Open Related Record: The Open Related Record action is a big time saver though some of its options and benefits may not be immediately obvious. It allows you to click on a property in the view you are currently in and open the record that is currently selected. You can find the Open Related Record action on the Home tab of the ribbon in the Open Related Record group. Imagine this, you've started a new Service and selected a customer. The customer is clearly not a minor but the service is requiring a guardian is present. The problem is that the customer's birthday has either been entered incorrectly or not entered at all in their customer profile. You can highlight the Customer property in the Service record and then click the Open Related Record button. This will open that customer's profile where you can correct their birthday and save and close that record. Now, the service is no longer requesting a guardian and you can proceed. Open Related Record is only available on properties that are a link to another object in the database known as reference objects. You can find out more about these objects in Lookup List Views. Workflow Show Virtual Receptionist History: When the Virtual Receptionist begins a workflow on an object it stores a history of what happened in the database. This history can be accessed with the Show Virtual Receptionist Instances action. You can find the Show Virtual Receptionist History action in the Home tab of the ribbon in the Workflow group of any list view or detail view. This is useful if you are alerted by a customer that they did not receive their text message or email appointment reminder. You can find their appointment, execute this action and see if that workflow ran or not and if so if it Completed, meaning they should have received it, or Aborted, meaning there was a problem when that workflow was run. Records Navigation Previous Record/Next Record: The Previous Record/Next Record actions allow you to navigate between objects in the database. In a detail view this is useful when trying to find or inspect certain data. You can open the detail view for the first object, then use the Next Record action to load the next object into the database into your currently loaded detail view.

By default, it appears on the left hand side of the Main Window. However, it can be moved or even hidden if you prefer. Navigation Groups Navigation Groups are containers for Navigation Items. They appear at the bottom of the Navigation Bar. By clicking a Navigation Group, the top portion of the Navigation Bar will populate with Navigation Items that belong to that group. For instance, clicking the Configuration navigation group will display the navigation items used to configureREV23 Desktop. Navigation Items Navigation Items are links to different screens in the Main Window. When you click on a navigation item, the main window's content will change to that item's view. Clicking the Customers navigation item, located in the Home navigation group will take you to the Customer List View. Change the height of the group list You can change the height of the group list to reduce how many groups are being shown if you have a smaller screen. To do this grab the splitter bar (the horizontal bar that separates the navigation groups and navigation items), and click and drag it down. As you move the mouse down, fewer groups will be shown. You can then access these groups from the bottom pane of the navbar. To show them again click and drag the splitter bar back up. You can also use the arrow button in the bottom right hand corner of the navbar to customize which groups are visible. Hiding the Navigation bar To save even more space on smaller screens, the Navigation Bar can be closed completely, or set to auto hide. It's also not uncommon for users to accidentally close the navbar and not understand what happened and call support. There are two buttons on the top of the navbar. Auto Hide (the pushpin) and hide (the close or X button). If you choose to Auto Hide the navbar, a small tab that says Navigation will appear on the left hand side of your main window where the navigation bar typically resides. When you hover your mouse over this tab, the navbar will slide into view allowing you to select an item and then close again. To dock the navbar back in its original position you will need to click the pushpin button again and the navbar will return. If you choose to Close the navbar (not recommended, but it's your UI!) the navigation bar will not appear at all. To navigate REV23 Desktop you will use the Navigation item in the View tab. You can click this button to drop down a menu which will allow you access to the navigation items. Showing the Navigation Bar after it's been hidden Whether you've closed the navbar on purpose or on accident you can restore it by going to the View tab in the ribbon, clicking the Panels item, select the Navigation panel, and set it to Visible. Additional navigation techniques Much like a web browser, you can navigate backwards and forward in your navigation history.

It's also not uncommon for users to accidentally close the navbar and not understand what happened and call support. There are two buttons on the top of the navbar. Auto Hide (the pushpin) and hide (the close or X button). If you choose to Auto Hide the navbar, a small tab that says Navigation will appear on the left hand side of your main window where the navigation bar typically resides. When you hover your mouse over this tab, the navbar will slide into view allowing you to select an item and then close again. To dock the navbar back in its original position you will need to click the pushpin button again and the navbar will return.

The Ribbon is the replacement for the standard toolbar many Windows users have been used to for decades. It is the modern way to help you find, understand, and use commands efficiently and directly with a minimum number of clicks, with less need to resort to trial-and-error, and without having to refer to Help. The Ribbon was first introduced in Microsoft Office 2007 and continues to be used and evolved in many Microsoft products. The Ribbon appears on top of the Main Window and in most Detail Views. By default it appears expanded at its full size, however it can be minimized to save room on your screen. It consists of tabs and actions (or buttons) that are grouped into sections, and the File menu on the far left. There are some actions on the ribbon that are consistent throughout REV23 Desktop. However, there are some that appear only in lists views, some that appear only in detail views and some that are specific to certain data types. The Ribbon in a generic List View. Notice the List View specific action 'New'. Also in this example notice the different elements. The Home tab is selected showing us it's actions. Also notice how the actions are contained in groups. For example, the 'New' button appears in the 'Records Creation' group. The Ribbon in a generic Detail View. Notice the Detail View specific actions 'Save' and 'Save and Close' that appear in the 'Save' group. Minimizing the Ribbon If you'd like to collapse the ribbon to save room on your screen you can double click on one of the ribbon tabs and the ribbon will minimize (only the application button and tabs will be visible). To access the actions in the ribbon when it is minimized, single click a tab and the ribbon will drop down allowing you temporary access to the full ribbon. After you execute an action the ribbon will minimize itself again. To expand the ribbon, just double click the tab again. There is also an arrow on the far right that allows you to collapse and expand the ribbon. The ribbon in its minimized state. Notice the arrow on the right hand side that allows you to minimize and expand the ribbon as desired. Collapsed Groups In some situations when there are more items to display on the ribbon than it can fit on your screen, groups will collapse. These groups are recognizable by an arrow pointing down. In order to access that groups items you need to click the group and a popup window will appear allowing you access to those items. Notice in this example the Workflow, Full Text Search groups are collapsed, while the View group's icon sizes have been reduced. Here, the Full Text Search group was clicked, allowing access to the search box. The File Menu The File Menu button shows File Menu. Here you can print and export as well as access some other useful features that are view specific. The File Menu always appears in the top left corner of REV23 Desktop. The file menu button. Depending on your selected skin the button may appear different. The application button's standard menu. Quick Access Toolbar Also part of the ribbon is the Quick Access Toolbar, which as you might guess allows you quick access to your favorite actions. By default, it appears in the top left hand corner of the ribbon. However it's position can be moved to below the ribbon if desired by clicking the 'Customize Quick Access Toolbar' button which appears on the right hand side of the list. The Quick Access Toolbar shows the Refresh, Previous Record, Next Record, Log Off and Touch Mode actions by default. The Quick Access Toolbar displayed below the Ribbon. Any action can be added to the Quick Access Toolbar by right clicking it and select the 'Add to Quick Access Toolbar' item. Alternatively you can remove items from the quick access toolbar by right clicking the action and selecting the 'Remove from Quick Access Toolbar' item. Right clicking an action such as the search box will show a popup menu that allows you to add an item to the Quick Access Toolbar.

The following topics will explain what those elements are, the terminology that will be used in this user guide, how to use those elements as well as how to customize their appearance. Due to the constant evolution of REV23 Desktop, screenshots in this user guide may not appear exactly as you see them on your screen. Features are regularly added and changed which occasionally modifies the user interface before we've had a chance to update the user guide. In this brief topic, we will talk about the terminology we use to refer to different areas of the user interface. Understanding this terminology will be valuable as you go through these docs. UI Short hand for user interface. Main Window The primary UI of REV23 Desktop. This window is where you will switch between area's of the software, generally to different list views. Navigation Bar Appearing only in the main window, the navigation bar provides access to grouped items that you will use to navigate around the software. Ribbon The ribbon is the tabbed toolbar on top of most windows, including the main window and most detail views. This provides access to various actions. Action A clickable control that performs some action, generally having the appearance of a button that is located on the ribbon and sometimes in detail views. Because they're not always a button, but sometimes a selector or other control, they're called actions, however we may refer to them occasionally as buttons if it makes more sense in the context. List View A list view is a collection of data, presented in a list format in a powerful grid. For example, a list of your customers. Column A column vertical (up & down) data in a list view. For example, the First Name property in the Customer list view. Row A row is horizontal (left & right) data in a list view. For example, one single and specific customer in the Customer list view. Detail View A detail view is a separate window from the main window which presents the data of a single object. For example, double clicking a row in the Customer list view will open that customer's detail view. This is where you will edit that record's data such as entering a first and last name. Property A property of the object in a detail view. For example, the First Name of a customer. Editor An editor is a control which allows you to edit a property of an object. For example a text editor will allow you to type text such as a customer's first and last name, while a date editor will present a calendar for you to pick a date for a birthday. Nested List View A nested list view is a list view that appears inside of a detail view to represent a collection of objects related to the detail view. For example, a list of services a customer has received at your studio. Nested list views have their own toolbars with specific actions such as deleting an object from that list. Lookup List View A lookup list view is a small list view that appears as a result of clicking some editors. They are used for selecting other objects in your database to link to the record. For example, when selecting a customer for a service, when clicking the \"Customer\" editor, you will be shown a small version of the Customer list view to select the customer who will be receiving the service.","title":"Terminology"},{"location":"ui/terminology/#ui-terminology","text":"There are several important elements that make up the REV23 Desktop user interface, which will sometimes be referred to as the UI.
